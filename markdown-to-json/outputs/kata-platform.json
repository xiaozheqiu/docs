your account by entering the password to continue the registration step 5 Login with your account In this step you will create a simple chatbot as in the image below Let s start Create a Project You will see all projects in the project dashboard A project consists of bot design NLU and CMS 1 Click Create Project to create a new project 2 Fill in project detail then click Create Project 3 After the project has been created you will be redirected to the Conversation Flow page to create flow state and action 4 Congratulations you successfully created a new project Create a Flow Flow is a conversation chatbot flow In this simple tutorial you will create 1 flow and use 1 default flow Default flow is a fallback flow or a flow to answer if questions are not understandable by a chatbot 1 In the Conversation Flow click the Create Flow 2 Fill in the flow name hello then click Create If a flow is successfully created it will show in the Conversation Flows sidebar Create a State The state is a step in a conversation A flow must have 1 state called the initial state and 1 state called the end state In this tutorial you will create 2 states in the flow hello which are init state and hello state Init state will become the initial state and the hello state becomes the end state 1 Click the icon in the Conversation Flow menu 2 In this step you will create an initial state Fill in the init state then turn on the toggle Initial State to set it as the initial state 3 Next create a hello state This state will be an end state so you must turn on the End State toggle Do a similar step with the second step In this step you will get an error that an end state must have at least 1 action So the next step is to create an action in the hello state Create an Action Action is a bot response in text images buttons interactive messages such as a carousel in LINE a generic template in FB Messenger and others A state must have at least 1 action except in the initial state This tutorial will create a text action in the hello state 1 Click in the hello state then it will show a form on the right screen 2 To create a new action click on the Add action button 3 Click on the icon Next it will show various available actions Choose action Text 4 After choosing a Text action it will show an interface like in the image below Input action name then click Add Variant button to input text response 5 Finishing your action by clicking the Create Action button 6 Then finalize the state by clicking the Create button Create an Intent A chatbot needs to understand end users input to show correct action or bot response The intent will recognize input in the Kata Platform by checking keywords NL or regex End user is a term for chatbot users This step will create an intent to catch when end users greet the chatbot 1 In the hello flow choose the Intent menu Next click Create Intent 2 Input intent detail with name helloIntent Then turn on toggle As Initial to create a trigger in the chatbot and execute the hello flow 3 Next continue to choose the Text type Input a condition to make the chatbot execute the intent when the end user sends the message Hello or start content Hello content start 4 Click the Create button to finish creating intent Create a Transition Transition is a procedure to move from one state to another state if a condition is fulfilled Create transition by pulling a line from the source state to the destination state like the image below 1 In this step you will create a transition between the init state and the hello state by pulling a line If you succeed to create a transition it will show a form on the right screen 2 Then input condition detail to create transition can be executed if an end user input is caught by helloIntent intent intent helloIntent 3 Click the Save button to finish creating the transition Publish Bot This publish feature is useful to save changes in the form of revision numbers The Publish button can be found on all Flow pages 1 In this step you will save the created bot design Click the Publish button which is placed in the top right corner 2 To ensure your bot is stored correctly enter the Revision List menu The revision list will show every new revision at the top Testing Your Bot In this step you will try a simple chatbot using the emulator feature 1 On the lower right of your screen click on the Test Chatbot button You will see a small window with a chat conversation interface if you succeed 2 Type Hello word If your chatbot works well then it will show the chatbot reply witn created action This image is the correct example 3 Congratulations your first chatbot is done Next continue to deploy your chatbot in messaging platform Telegram Create a Deployment Deployment is a step to merge all Revisions in Flow NLU and CMS so that bots can be integrated into the channel Before starting channel integration chatbots must at least have 1 deployment 1 In the sidebar choose the Deploy menu Then choose Overview 2 Click the New Deployment button then it will show a form on the right screen 3 Choose the deployment version In Kata Platform there are 3 deployment versions Major to deploy big changes such as change chatbot use case Minor to deploy medium changes such as adding new features in your chatbot Patch to deploy small changes such as change copy in action 4 Then click the Submit button If deployment is successful then the interface will be shown like this Create an Environment Step after creating a deployment is to create an environment An environment is a zone in

      "contents": "Introduction Natural Language Understanding NLU is a computer s ability to transform a text message into a structured object In the Kata Platform NLU is a place for users to design and build their NLU capability for their conversational AI product How to Use This guide will teach you how to integrate NLU into your chatbot to recognize specific end users input Before you start you will need to create at least one entity 1 To create an entity go to the NLU menu Then click the Entity menu 2 Click Create Entity to set up a new entity It will show a form on the right screen Fill in the entity name 3 Inherit lets you copy an entity from any public NLU on the Kata Platform To inherit an NLU type the NLU ID with username project name Inherited entities will sync to the original entity including the labels and training data For example in the getting started chatbot kata platform documentation content start your first chatbot section your NLU ID format is muhfadhiilkata test_simple_bot 4 Type is intended for the entity type We have 3 entity types in the Kata Platform Trait is a text classifier to classify a sentence into a particular labels This type is suitable for making your bot recognize nuance in a sentence Dictionary is a word tagger which has keys and labels It will form an array The Phrase is a word tagger 5 The Profile is an AI model that is available to use by users Depending on data training and your dataset you can choose any profiles you want The default profile is suitable for many data samples so that this profile is available in all entity types intent profile is suitable for entity type trait default_v2 profile is our newest profile and is suitable if you have a large amount of data 6 Root enables you to create an entity using other users NLU to copy the training data and add new labels Therefore it is suitable if you have a trained NLU and want to add more labels in the NLU You can type an NLU ID which consists of username and project with format username project name 7 Labels are a feature to determine classes or categories from an entity To add a new label you can type and press enter on your keyboard If you choose entity type dictionary it will show a dropdown name Belongs to This feature enables you to define relationships between entities Belongs to feature can only be used for entities in the same NLU with entity type phrase or dictionary It is suitable if your data sample is like this Saya mau beli es kopi susu 2 dan less sugar Es kopi susu is the main menu 2 and less sugar are modifiers to detailing the order So in Belongs To concept you will tag 2 and choose belongsTo Training your NLU After creating an entity and labels you have to train them 1 Go to NLU gt Training menu 2 Then you will see 2 choices to train your entities Single training is a way to train sentences training data one by one Bulk training is a way to train up to 200 sentences training data by uploading a txt file with annotations inside the file These are steps to train your NLU using single training 1 For example to train 1 sentence for your NLU type a sentence then press enter on the keyboard to review the training For example Saya ingin membeli kopi susu 2 Next you can preview the sentence first and tag your entities You can block or double click in a word to tag a word Then it will show a dropdown to choose entities and labels in format entity name label name You can select a dropdown at the bottom of the entities list for tagging a sentence 3 Click the Train button to submit training data These are steps to train your NLU using bulk training 1 First open your text and source code editor Notepad notepad sublime 2 Create a new file 3 You will create training data using a simple syntax for entity type trait and for entity type phrase Example for entity type trait Saya mau pesan pizza intent order It means the sentence is classified into an entity named intent with the label order Example for entity type phrase and dictionary Saya mau pesan tiket ke destination Malang atas nama ner person Budi intent order It means the word Malang is tagged for entity name destination and Budi is tagged for entity name ner with label person 4 Save the following training data into training data example txt 5 Go to NLU gt Training in Platform Then click on the Bulk Training button 6 Click on the Browse button to open the file explorer finder or drag and drop the file into the browse file dialog 7 Wait for the upload process 8 After the upload is complete you can review the training data file in the Platform 9 Click on the Train button to train the data 10 You will see a customer satisfaction survey after using the feature Fill in the survey then click X to close the dialog 11 You have successfully trained your NLU with the uploaded data Every training will make your NLU smarter measured by a confidence score The confidence score is how the NLU recognizes end users input between 0 and 1 Test Your NLU You can test if your NLU is good enough or wrong in the Kata Platform by using the Test NLU feature These are the steps 1 Click the Test NLU button on the right bottom of your screen 2 Then it will show a chat window 3 Type in the chatbox a sentence to test your NLU The best practice is to prepare data training and data testing separately but they must have similarities When you enter a sentence or data testing a result is shown For example here is how to read the result from the test NLU example id abf78 input halo output kata product Intent type trait value bayar start 0 end 4 score 0 8116588592529297 label bayar Let s break them down 1 It is a sentence or word that you typed input halo 2 Two entities are not detected by your input halo so that the results are null output kata product 3 There is a detected entity called Intent and the entity type is trait Then start and end mean character count from hello Next score means a confidence score from the NL model to predict the sentence or word from end users Lastly the label labels under the entity that the word or sentence detected Intent type trait value bayar start 0 end 4 score 0 8116588592529297 label bayar Finally you understand the basics of creating NLU and how to train it Now let s improve your knowledge by following our advanced guidelines to design NLU and training it Advanced guidelines to design and train your NLU Designing NLU You can create NLU depending on your needs The more complex an NLU the larger training data is required to build it A few things you must consider when designing an NLU are 1 The total number of labels in an entity 2 NLU complexity impacts training process complexity as well 3 The total number of entities in an NLU An entity will have its model so the more entities you owned then the longer the training process In the next part you will learn several suggestions to reduce complexity and make the training process easier First suggestion Dividing entity type trait into a few entities If an entity has too many labels e g 50 labels it will require at least 50 training data Moreover you will need larger training data to reach a high prediction result score if sentences between labels are alike To help this problem you can break down labels from an entity into a few entities For example you have an entity type intent as follows NLU name nl 1 Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels lupa_pin ganti_pin kartu_hilang buku_tabungan_hilang ganti_kartu ganti_buku_tabungan buat_kartu cara_daftar_nasabah You can break down it into 2 differents entities as follows NLU name nl 2 First entity Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels lupa ganti ganti buat hilang Second Entity Entity name topic Entity type trait Entity profile topic Labels pin kartu buku_tabungan nasabah This method can increase your model prediction score by dividing the score into several groups of labels From the example above the first NLU nl 1 will divide the prediction score 1 00 into 8 different labels for the intent entity Otherwise the second NLU nl 2 will divide the prediction score 1 00 into 4 labels for the intent entity and 4 labels for the topic entity Important note This suggestion is recommended if you have limited training data If you have a large amount of training data or there are no problems with your current training data this suggestion is unnecessary Second suggestion Utilize profile intent Another tip is to use an intent profile which is influenced by predictions from other models type phrase or type dictionary This way can make the training process if training data is limited and sentences form alike Important note This suggestion applies to entity type trait with intent profile only First example given a training data dimana tempat perpanjang sim paling dekat ask_nearby_simstnk dimana tempat perpanjang stnk sekitar sini ask_nearby_simstnk dimana kantor polisi terdekat ask_nearby_polisi And you have an NLU with the detail as follows NLU name nl v1 Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_nearby_simstnk ask_nearby_polisi This NLU can be changed into NLU name nl v2 First entity Entity name simstnk Entity type dict Entity profile default Key sim Labels sim surat izin mengemudi Key stnk Labels stnk surat tanda kendaraan bermotor Second entity Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_nearby_simstnk ask_nearby_polisi NLU nl v2 will make the training process faster because the words sim and stnk are in one similar category which is simstnk However there is a case that you need to be aware of An intent profile can remove the detailed information Here is an example The second example given training data resep untuk membuat pizza bbq apa ya ask_bbq_recipe pizza pepperoni gimana cara buatnya ya ask_pepperoni_recipe kasih tau dong resep pizza aas buatanmu ask_aas_recipe Then you will have an NLU NLU name nl v1 Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_bbq_recipe ask_pepperoni_recipe ask_aas_recipe Next you change the NLU structure into this NLU name nl v2 First entity Entity name pizza Entity type dict Entity profile default Key bbq Labels bbq barbeque Key pepperoni Labels pepperoni peperoni Key aas Labels aas american all star Second entity Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_bbq_recipe ask_pepperoni_recipe ask_aas_recipe The intent entity in nlu v1 can recognize the differentiation between labels Otherwise nl v2 cannot acknowledge it because bbq pepperoni and aas are set up as one category pizza If users input a sentence resep buat bbq apa ya the score will show the same results from all labels If you still want to use dictionary type for this second example you can try this way NLU name nl v3 First entity Entity name pizza Entity type dict Entity profile default Key bbq Labels bbq barbeque Key pepperoni Labels pepperoni peperoni Key aas Labels aas american all star Second entity Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_pizza_recipe The nl v3 can recognize a sentence has ask_pizza_recipe intent and can specify which pizza by using pizza entity This method is helpful to make your bot easy to understand limited words such as product names Otherwise this suggestion is not recommended if you re using generic words Third suggestion Dividing NLU A bot can have multiple NLU Here are a few cases in which NLU can be divided Use specific NLU for certain flows Some flows in a bot may have a particular NLU for a flow which means input to trigger the flow is different from other flows This way can reduce the number of listed labels in an entity and ease the prediction process Examples Using credential NLU which is executed when the user first interacts with the bot Using order NLU in commerce bot will be executed when the user chooses the order menu Use specific NLU for certain states Few states in a bot may have similar input but have different meanings depending on what states are running You can configure the NLU in state condition Examples YesNo NLU can be used in overall flows but shall be specified in states that require end users confirmation Note You can use these methods if you have too many labels data between labels are alike a limited number of training data predictions result is not optimal yet or found other problems But if your NLU is fine you can create an entity with many labels Training Guideline The training process is required to make a bot response to end users messages and requires training data In NLU a training process will also train all models read entities For example NLU A has entity 1 entity 2 and entity 3 Because each entity owns its models NLU A has 3 models that run individually If you input training data for NLU A you train entity 1 entity 2 and entity 3 models Here are suggestions that you need to consider in the training process Add various forms of language Input training data with various forms such as formal informal slang long or short sentences If you only train a form e g formal then the model may understand formal sentences Avoid imbalanced data between labels The imbalanced data affect bias between labels A small amount of imbalanced data is not a problem However if you have a large amount of imbalanced data the predictions result too significant on specific labels and a bias Add counter training Counter training means you input training data that is not classified to current labels For example You have an entity that can predict book genres into 3 categories read labels horror fiction and biography Each label has been trained and can recognize each genre Then an input is entered with a new category named history Because the model only distinguishes between the 3 labels and assumes that each book must be categorized into 3 labels the model cannot answer not all three or none To make the model understand history input you have to enter training data without giving any intent tags Add a new label to the trained entity If you want to add a new label train the label with a similar total amount of training with current labels For example You have an entity with 5 labels Each label has 10 training data Then you add a new label Your next step will be to train the label equal to or more than 10 training data The final step is to train the other 5 labels with a few training data Ambiguous data Avoid preparing ambiguous training data into different labels Ambiguous data means you input the same training data but the context depends on what end users asked For example End user sends the word sudah if your bot asks a question about apakah sudah makan Smalltalk flow or apakah sudah menikah Credential flow Both sentences can be recognized as intent doneEating read entity intent with label doneEating or intent married read entity intent with label married To reduce this ambiguity case you shall prepare training data as follows Input training data such as sudah menikah in intent married There is an additional word menikah that could distinguish the labels For the word sudah train it to a different label such as intent done For the bot implementation you shall put a condition intent done for states executed when end users said sudah word Relationship between bot NL and training process Bot development used NL in bot and training process is influencing each other Bot implementation can process some limitations encountered in NL results through the bot NL complexity is affected by bot complexity So the more complex a bot the more complex the NL will be and the more training data For NL it is possible to mispredict a few data It is a usual case You can solve this by adding training data or post processing in the bot This is the end of the guidance You can contact support kata ai if you have any difficulties when implementing this",

based on our Kata ai projects data Previously the bulk training process was very technical because developers needed to use KataCLI and view the results on the Platform GUI This back and forth switching of tools was required to do training Now you can use the new Bulk Training on the Platform GUI itself to train more than 200 sentences training data at once These are the screenshots of our newest feature You can click on this video tutorial or go to the NLU gt Training menu check the screenshot below How Bulk Training Might Help You Training NL models is one of the most time consuming processes in chatbot development which could take approximately 6 weeks On average a complex chatbot project requires 1 000 data for their NL models It s not ideal to train the sentences one by one as a typical 1 000 sentence NL model would easily take more than 4 hours to train Hence bulk training can significantly reduce the training effort with a simplified user flow How to Use Bulk Training Create a Project Mission Create a new project Prerequisite You already have a Platform account and have logged in 1 Click on the Create Project button 2 Fill in the required fields for the project 3 Click Create Project Create Entities And Labels With Type trait Mission Create NL models to be trained and type entity trait Learn more about entity type trait Prerequisites You already have a project 1 Go to NLU 2 Click on Entities 3 Click the Create Entity button to start creating entities and labels Learn more about entities and labels or you may want to explore how to design the NLU 4 Fill in fields with this example Entity name intent Type trait Profile default Text classification 5 To create labels you need to type and press enter to save a new label Fill in with these examples Labels

means state definitions actions Dict which means action definitions methods Dict which means Flow specific method definitions Additionally a flow can be set as following active boolean which means you can enable disable a flow by setting the active field of a flow volatile boolean which means you can set it to true then it will close the flow whenever it s outside the flow expire number which means it will set flow to expire after a specified number of milliseconds Building an intent Intent can be defined as following intents The intent description contains following fields type text command data which is to define type of the message to be associated with this intent condition string string which is condition filter to rule out certain intents to be selected classifier Classifier Classifier which is classifier definition attributes Dict which is attributes slot filling associated with the intent fallback boolean which means define intent as fallback intent priority number which means set priority of an intent for the selection process initial boolean which means set whether intent can be triggered only in current flow or from other flow as well Defining condition Condition is every valid javascript expression returning a boolean Available variables are type string which is a message type payload JsonObject which means message payload content string which means message content context JsonObject which means flow context data JsonObject which means session data config JsonObject which means bot config Example condition type text amp amp content hello amp amp context completed Building classifier Classifier consists of following fields nlu string which means name of defined NLU or NLU type hint string which means prepend message with a text fragment match string which means match the result of the classifier with a specific string options JsonObject which means override NLU options process method method which means postprocess intent using methods

specify initial state action string StateAction StateAction which means specify action to be executed end boolean which means specify end state transitions Dict which means specify transitions float Transition which means specify floating transition enter Mapping method which means specify mapping or method to be executed when state is entered transit Mapping method which means specify mapping or method to be executed when transition is started exit Mapping method which means specify mapping or method to be executed when state is exited Defining mapping Mapping is a procedure to update context data available variables are attributes JsonObject which is attributes that is captured by intent intent string which is captured intent content string which is message content payload JsonObject which is message payload context JsonObject which is flow context data JsonObject which is session data Example enter \t data name attributes name \t context count context count 0 Example using method

\t\toptions \t\t text hi data name \t name reply \t\tcondition context mood bad \t\toptions \t\t text apaan sih kamu You can simplify state actions if you only have 1 action in some states action someAction Building transition Transition define condition that leads to moving from one state to the other state A transition is defined as following transitions \t Field definition condition string which means condition that trigger the transition priority number which means priority for transition selection fallback boolean which means define fallback when no other transition matches mapping Mapping method which means define mapping or method that is triggered during this transition Example transitions \t askDob \t\tcondition intent yes amp amp context personGender amp amp context verifyGender \t\tmapping \t\t context personGender context verifyGender \t\t context verifyGender null You can simplify transitions definition transitions \taskDob intent yes amp amp context personGender Building a floating State Normally it is tedious if we have to define a transition to a state that is available in every state e g Cancel state To mitigate this we can define a floating transition The system will automatically attach this transition in every state float Defining events We can define a mapping or method that is triggered during these events enter which means this event is triggered when entering a state transit which means this event is triggered before transition process exit which means this event is triggered after transition process Building Meta Context Additional meta context accessible in states at context start boolean which means true if state is initial state to string which means describe destination state Available during exit from string which means describe origin state Available during enter end boolean which means true if state is end state Example states \t stateA \t\tenter \t\t context stateACount context stateACount 0

which means action type method method which means specify if action type is method options JsonObject which means action options condition string which means action condition Example actions \t askName \t\ttype reply \t\toptions \t\t text nama kamu siapa Flow Switching Whenever bot reaches a state that is not an end state the flow will stay open The following message will trigger a transition to the next state There is a case where the incoming message cannot be handled by any intents in current flow In that case it will try to find a flow with a matching intent When the second flow closes the system will create internal message reenter \ttype command \tcontent reenter \tpayload null this reenter need to be catched by the previous flow that is open intents \treenter \t\ttype

attribute features You can add more than 1 NLUs Then it enables the intent to check all NLUs 3 Then NLUs will check the threshold The threshold can act as a confidence level and these values range from 0 0 completely uncertain to 1 0 completely confident This confidence level is usually set between 0 7 to 0 8 Finally NLUs will check whether the confidence score from the incoming message is lower or higher than the threshold If an incoming message is lower than the threshold NLUs will send bot information that the incoming message is incorrect with what NLU had recognized Then the intent will be checked by other NLUs If an incoming message is equal to or higher than the threshold NLUs will send information that the condition is correct 4 If NLUs condition has matched then intent will send information to a bot that incoming message from the end user is recognized as intent yesNL for example 5 Then the bot will check the following action if an intent condition has been fulfilled For example if the transition has condition intent yesNL then the bot will execute the next state connected between the transition Check the image below for more detail How to Use To integrate NLU can be implemented in chatbot these are the steps 1 First in the Kata Platform go to the Flow menu Then click the NLUs menu in the sidebar 2 Click on the Create NLU button Then it will show a form on the right screen 3 Fill in NLUs name and choose an NLU Type For this guide you will select NL 4 On the NLU ID search and dropdown you will search your NLU to integrate it into your chatbot NLU ID consists of username and project with format username project name For example in the getting started chatbot section kata platform documentation content start your first chatbot your NLU ID format is muhfadhiilkata test_simple_bot You can use NLU ID from another project as long as the project is set as public 5 Threshold can act as a confidence level and these values range from 0 0 completely uncertain to 1 0 completely confident This confidence level is usually set between 0 7 to 0 8 So the data that falls under 0 7 0 8 will not be detected by the bot The field only allows numbers and decimals to separate using the character 6 As Intent is a feature to collect available labels in the NLU The field only allows alphanumerics 7 Output has several output types depending on the entity type you used Output Types Functionals Raw Use this output type if your entity type is trait It will result in raw sentences Dictionary Use this output type if your entity type is dictionary It will result in an array consisting of keys and labels Phrase Using supermodel kata entity you must use this output type 8 Path is a feature to support integration with Supermodel 9 Click Create to finish your NLUs For example you must integrate an NLU ID muhfadhiilkata test_simple_bot which has 1 entity name topic and entity type is trait to an intent named topic The entity topic has 2 labels FAQ order and buy The first step is you will fill in the NLUs form as follows NLU Name topic nl NLU Type NL NLU ID muhfadhiilkata test_simple_bot Threshold 0 8 As Intent topic Output Raw Next you will define this NLU inside an intent So you will create an intent named topic 1 Go to the Conversation Flows menu then click on the Intent tab 2 Click the Create Intent button Then a form will show on the right screen 3 In Intent Type choose Text to start setup 4 Next click the button Add classifier This feature enables you to insert your NLUs inside the intent so intent can match whether end user input is understandable by the NLU or not First there is a dropdown to choose available NLUs then select topic nl 5 Then click the button Add attribute This feature enables you to insert your NLUs inside the intent similar to the Add Classifier feature with differentiation that bot developers can create a condition in the state or transition by using the entity s label It is because an attribute is a variable that has an array form 6 Click Create to create an intent Test Your Chatbot 1 To test your chatbot you can see it in the bottom right corner of your screen 2 Click the Test Chatbot to start 3 Type a sentence or word 4 You can see incoming messages that you typed blue color and bot response white color by clicking the eye icon under the message bubble Here is how to read the incoming message type means message source which is from the emulator owner means the account that typed the message For outgoing messages or bot responses here is how to read them type means executed action type For this example it uses a text action type content means your message to test the bot action means executed action name flow means executed flow name intent means which intent recognized your message This is the end of the guidance You can contact support kata ai if you have any difficulties when implementing this",

      "contents": "Introduction Training Data Generator is a feature that enables you to automatically generate training data up to 100 data using sentence samples or we call it data samples Before creating a data sample you will need to define the keyword and synonyms inside the word bank feature Why is it required We do permutations from data samples and keyword variants to generate the training data Let s try a case 1 You create a word bank from Kenapa which consists of variant words or synonyms from Kenapa For example knp ngap ngaps kenaps So you have 4 word variants 2 Next you create a data sample For example Kenapa ATM saya bermasalah ya 3 We will create a permutation or combination from a data sample with variant words For example expected generated data will be like this knp ATM saya bermasalah ngap ATM saya bermasalah ATM saya bermasalah ngaps kenaps ATM saya bermasalah And many more 4 Also we have a feature that is bulk tagging to tag all generated training data with your available entities and labels It enables faster tagging rather than manually annotating This guidance will elaborate on how to use training data generators and do bulk tagging after generated data shows up Let s get started Create Entity and Labels Before you start you will need to create at least one entity 1 To create an entity go to the NLU gt Models menu Then click the Entity menu 2 Click Create Entity to set up a new entity It will show a form on the right screen Fill in the entity name Here is the explanation of each field 1 Inherit lets you copy an entity from any public NLU on the Kata Platform To inherit an NLU simply type the NLU ID with username project name Inherited entities will sync to the original entity including the labels and training data For example in the getting started chatbot section kata platform documentation content start your first chatbot your NLU ID format is muhfadhiilkata test_simple_bot 2 Type is intended for the entity type In Kata Platform we have 3 entity types which are Trait is a text classifier that classifies a sentence into particular labels This type is suitable for making your bot recognize nuance in a sentence Dictionary is a word tagger which has keys and labels It will form an array The Phrase is a word tagger 3 The Profile is an AI model that is available to use by users You can choose any profiles you want depending on data training and the dataset you have The default profile is suitable for a large number of data samples so that this profile is available in all entity types intent profile is suitable for entity type trait default_v2 profile is our newest profile and is suitable if you have a large amount of data 4 Root enables you to create an entity using other users NLU to copy the training data and add new labels Therefore it is suitable if you have a trained NLU and want to add more labels in the NLU To use this you can type an NLU ID which consists of username and project with format username project name 5 Labels is a feature to determine classes or categories from an entity To add a new label you can type and press enter on your keyboard 6 If you choose entity type dictionary it will show a dropdown name Belongs to This feature enables you to define relationships between entities Belongs to feature can only be used for entities in the same NLU with entity type phrase or dictionary It is suitable if your data sample is like this Saya mau beli es kopi susu 2 dan less sugar Es kopi susu is the main menu 2 and less sugar are modifiers to detailing the order So in Belongs To concept you will tag 2 and choose belongsTo For this guide you will create 1 entity type trait to extract sentences 1 entity type phrase and 1 entity type dictionary to extract words 1 Click the Create Entity button 2 Then fill in as follows for the first entity Name intent Type Trait Label statement Here is the screenshot 3 Click the Create Entity button to create the following entity 4 Fill in as follows for the second entity Name object Type phrase Label person Here is the screenshot 5 Fill in as follows for the last entity Name things Type dictionary Key car Labels suv van lcgc Here is the screenshot 6 Click Create to finalize The next step is to create a word bank when you re done Create a Word Bank In this part you will create synonyms or variants from the keyword Here is the guidance for adding variants You can add 2 words as 1 variant by using space Maximum 20 characters You must create at least 2 variants to create a word bank with a maximum of 20 characters for each variant You can remove a variant by clicking the x button next to the word Step by step to create a word bank 1 Click the Word Bank tab then click the Create button It will show a dialog 2 Fill in the name for your word bank For example you can fill in Kenapa 3 Then create variants by typing a synonym from Kenapa word For example ngaps ngapa kenp knp kenopo 4 Press Enter on your keyboard 5 Finally you have variants Then click the Create button to create a word bank Create a Data Sample Once you ve created a word bank now you re ready to make a data sample Data sample is a sample sentence that consists of a word bank and several words as a base to generate training data or called a pattern Here are the steps 1 Go to NLU gt Training 2 Click on Bulk Training dropdown then choose Data Generator 3 You will see a row to input a data sample For example to add your available word bank type to show the word bank list 4 Input a data sample for example Kenapa kemarin Sinta tidak sekolah 5 Press Add Row to submit 6 You can edit or delete your data sample after it has been created On the data sample page there is information Total data possibilities mean total generated data that can be created from available data samples So for this example you have 2 data samples multiplied with 1 word bank then multiply again with 5 word variants So finally there will be 10 data possibilities Data to Generate is several generated data that you wanted The number must be below or equal to the total data possibilities Important note Make sure you put a space before the next word or after the previous word Example Kenapa Sinta tidak sekolah or Aku lagi Kenapa ya hari ini Generate Training Data This step will guide you to generate training data from created data samples Generated training data might not match your expectations because we are duplicating words However you can prepare the training data and do bulk training instead if you want specific training data Learn more about bulk training 1 Before you start ensure your data samples are created The generate button will enable if data samples are available and data to generate is equal to or below the total data possibilities 2 Let s put 10 data to generate 3 Click the Generate button on the top right of your screen 4 It redirects you to the Generated Data page where you can train using the bulk labeling feature 5 You will see a training data list as follows 6 You can delete generated data by clicking on the remove button in the list Bulk labeling You re going to train generated data by using bulk labeling Bulk labeling is a feature to tag entity type trait phrase or dictionary by doing it at once Let s start to tag an entity type trait that you ve created before 1 In the Bulk Labeling section select the entity name intent This entity type is trait 2 Next it will show available labels in the entity Because you only create 1 label then select the statement label Important note Bulk labeling for entity type trait will tag all generated data 3 Click the button Add more entity Then select the entity name object 4 Next select the person label Then it will show a text area named Words to Tag Words to Tag is a feature to search words you want to tag For example you will tag sinta word 5 Press Enter on your keyboard to submit the word It will show like this Important note Bulk labeling for entity type phrase and dictionary will tag words only 6 Then add the entity dictionary type Click Add more Entity to start Then select entity name things Then it will show a text area named Words to Tag Words to Tag is a feature to search words you want to tag For example you will tag a sekolah word Important note Bulk labeling for entity type dictionary will not show specific labels to tag So it will train the entity 7 Finally you can click the button Train It will train all generated data into entity intent with statement label and entity object with person label 8 When successfully trained you will redirect to the Training page On this page you can see the generated data has been trained 9 You can click the arrow on the right of the box to open the trained data detail Limitations There are several important notes when using a data generator such as You can create unlimited data samples and word banks but the system only generates up to 100 training data You can create data again if you want to add more than 100 generated training data or sentences It recommended using new data samples when generating new training data to make similar combination training data or sentence results If you re not satisfied with generated training data we recommend these approaches Create a new data sample with a different pattern from previous data samples If you want a specific sentence but the system does not show what you want then we recommend you to use the training feature in NLU gt Training instead If you have another NLU and want to use word banks or data samples from the current project it cannot be done now The bulk labeling feature is only for the Data Generator feature You cannot use it for now independently This is the end of the guidance You can contact support kata ai
