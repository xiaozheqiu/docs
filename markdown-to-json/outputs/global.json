      "contents": "Starting February 1 2022 WhatsApp will switch from a notification based pricing model to a conversation based pricing model Businesses will no longer be charged for sent notifications instead they will be charged per conversation See how it works below for more information Terms amp Definitions Conversation A session that occurs between businesses and users within 1x24 hours Conversation via WhatsApp can be initiated by both businesses and users User Initiated Conversation A conversation initiated by a user to a business This session starts when the business responds to the first message from a customer within 1x24 hours either using an automated chatbot or an agent manually via the omnichannel dashboard If the business replies to messages more than 1x24 hours from the user s first message then the session will be considered a Business Initiated Conversation Business Initiated Conversation A conversation initiated by a business to a user usually in the form of a notification template message formerly known as a Template Message or a message used to follow up on a User Initiated Conversation that has lasted more than 1x24 hours This session will be open for 1x24 hours starting from the first message sent by the business and in that session the business is only charged for one session even if it sends more than one message template Kata Business Dashboard Product of Kata ai for WhatsApp Business Platform management formerly called WhatsApp Business API WABA Businesses can register purchase credit independently as well as perform uses such as number verification submission and sending of template messages and monitoring usage of purchased credits Credit Represents the right to a number of conversations that are paid in advance in the form of pulses in the amount of Rupiah currency which can be reduced by the unit price of User Initiated Conversations and or Business Initiated Conversations Top Up Credit a system of adding credit in bulk or wholesale paid in advance Top Up Pricing Tier Fee structuring system for top up credit where purchases with a larger value will get a bigger discount How It Works WhatsApp Business API conversations fall into two different priced categories 1 User initiated such as customer service and general inquiries Inbound 2 Business initiated such as notifications and notifications Outbound All conversations or Conversations are measured in 24 hour increments also known as Sessions which start each time the first message is delivered by the business The first message can be a response to a user question or a business initiated message template that is being delivered Charges for conversations are based on the end user s phone number Rates for business initiated and user initiated conversations vary by market country or region See Rates for specific pricing information The first 1 000 conversations each month will be free so your business can start building experiences your customers will love before they have to pay In addition conversations will not be charged when a user sends a message to a business using the call to action button on an Ad that clicks into WhatsApp or a Facebook Page CTA Scenarios Disclaimer This scenario is based on The Official Facebook documentation The complete scenario can be found here For the following scenarios we will use a user named Anne Budianto a Commercial Air airline customer and Kicks an online shoe retailer Anne prefers to use WhatsApp to message businesses as it is the fastest way to get the support and information she needs Commercial Air and Kicks know that many of their customers prefer to connect via WhatsApp so they are ready to answer questions or send important updates via message 1 User Initiated Conversation UIC Scenario 1 User customer service or general support questions in one 24 hour conversation session 1 Our user Anne Budianto messaged Commercial Air with a question about an upcoming reservation When a Commercial Air reply message is sent a 24 hour conversation session will start 2 In this scenario all additional messages are free within a 24 hour session This encourages Commercial Air to follow up with support questions in a timely manner while giving users the ability to exchange as many messages as needed to resolve issues in a 24 hour session 3 If Commercial Air continues to exchange messages with Anne after the initial 24 hour conversation session has ended they will be charged for the new conversation They will also be asked to send a message template to start a new conversation if it has been more than 24 hours since Anne s last message which will be charged as a business initiated conversation In this scenario Anne gets the info she needs about her reservation and Commercial Air pays for a single user initiated conversation Cost IDR 320 for 1 UIC Scenario 2 A user customer initiated conversation that leads to two conversations with a Message Template 1 Anne wanted to check on an order she had made with Kicks an online shoe retailer He did it at 13 13 2 Kicks have a bot set up to reply to basic order inquiries and respond to Anne with delivery details at 13 13 3 As a follow up the next day the Kicks bot notified Anne that her order had shipped at 3 45 p m In this scenario Kicks pays for one user initiated conversation and one business initiated conversation Cost IDR 820 for 1 UIC amp 1 BIC 2 Business Initiated Conversation UIC Scenario 3 Business initiates sending notification messages using Message Templates 1 When a flight is delayed or its status changes Commercial Air notifies customers who have chosen to receive notifications using message templates 2 Two message templates sent in one 24 hour conversation session result in one business initiated conversation fee In this scenario Commercial Air wants to inform Anne that her flight is delayed by 30 minutes Commercial Air will charge for one business initiated conversation for sending these two message templates to Anne in a 24 hour conversation session Cost IDR 500 for 1 BIC Scenario 4 The business initiates a conversation that leads to a two way conversation with the user customer 1 When a customer places a new order from Kicks the online retailer sends a text message to confirm the order has been received and asks the customer if they would like to receive a notification when the order is shipped 2 The customer selects Yes and chooses to receive additional order notifications In this scenario Kicks pays for one conversation initiated by the business If the user replies more than 24 hours after sending the initial business message and is followed by a business reply it will result in a new conversation initiated by the user Cost a IDR 500 for 1 BIC if the user does not reply to the message b IDR 500 for 1 BIC if the user replies within 1x24 hours c IDR 820 for 1 BIC amp 1 UIC if the user replies after 1x24 hours These are four common conversation scenarios between businesses and users If you still have questions regarding the comparison of the scenarios above not limited to other possibilities that can occur between business and user conversations please contact the Kata ai team to discuss it further Pricing The pricing scheme continues to use the credit system with a top up in bulk Imagine buying a prepaid cell phone number that will be reduced by Business Initiated Conversation and or User Initiated Conversation according to the number of conversations initiated by businesses and users Don t worry because no major changes have occurred We only convert credit purchases that previously used the number of messages to be sent into Rupiah currency values that can be used for the existing types of conversations The tiering system still applies the more credits you buy the bigger the discount you get To accommodate changes in pricing schemes that occur said the Business Dashboard to be updated to make it easier to use and monitor credit and the amount of usage The latest update will be released on February 1 2022 along with the price changes of the WhatsApp Business API 1 IDR for Indonesian

before ramping up volumes 4 Monitor quality metrics like phone level quality scores green yellow red available in the Business Manager UI and via API",

available buttons Call to Actions CTA or Quick Replies A call to action button allows you to include your website URL and or your business phone number so your audience can quickly visit your website or contact your business with a single tap For the visit website URL button you can choose a static or dynamic URL type A dynamic URL type lets you personalize the website link by having a variable at the end of the link The use case is for example when you want to inform a tracking order to your audiences A quick reply button lets your audience quickly reply to your message You can create up to three quick reply buttons in a message template When using quick reply you have to define the payload for every button you created to return the correct reply when customers tap the buttons Variable Using variables in your message template is a way to personalize your message to your audience and to reuse your template message for different occasions A variable is written in two enclosing curly brackets with a number inside a bracket e g 1 It represents changing content and can be implemented in the text header and body content as well as when you include a dynamic URL button on your message template Here is an example of using variables in a message You can use variables for cases such as when you want to mention your customers names information on price promoted items promotion dates location etc The contents for the variables should be provided in the CSV format when creating a new broadcast using a certain message template Sample Variable For all variables you created throughout your template message content you have to add sample contents to help Facebook better understand the use case during the review process 1 After you fill the message template form click add sample 2 A modal will appear Fill in all the variable fields You can also provide a sample for the media header image document or video After adding all samples click Done Message Template Best Practices 1 Template message with the floating parameters will not be approved by WhatsApp please surround the parameter with context information so it is clear what variable will be filled in the parameter Example of floating parameter Selamat datang di Toko Sejahtera 1 In this example there is no clear information on what variable will be inserted in parameter 1 The CORRECT way to create the variable i Nomor pesanan Anda 2 ii Berikut total pesanan Anda 3 2 Template with spelling mistakes will not be accepted example Instead of using two curly brackets you mistakenly type the variable in one curly bracket Example Correct 2 Wrong 2 Please type the parameter based on sequenced numbers Example 1 2 3 3 Template message contains potentially abusive threatening content is not allowed a Threaten customers with a course of legal action will be rejected b Threaten the customer if they don t pay their loan will also be rejected 4 Additional best practice guidelines are outlined here",

the init state then turn on the toggle Initial State to set it as the initial state 3 Next create a hello state This state will be an end state so you must turn on the End State toggle Do a similar step with the second step In this step you will get an error that an end state must have at least 1 action So the next step is to create an action in the hello state Create an Action Action is a bot response in text images buttons interactive messages such as a carousel in LINE a generic template in FB Messenger and others A state must have at least 1 action except in the initial state This tutorial will create a text action in the hello state 1 Click in the hello state then it will show a form on the right screen 2 To create a new action click on the Add action button 3 Click on the icon Next it will show various available actions Choose action Text 4 After choosing a Text action it will show an interface like in the image below Input action name then click Add Variant button to input text response 5 Finishing your action by clicking the Create Action button 6 Then finalize the state by clicking the Create button Create an Intent A chatbot needs to understand end users input to show correct action or bot response The intent will recognize input in the Kata Platform by checking keywords NL or regex End user is a term for chatbot users This step will create an intent to catch when end users greet the chatbot 1 In the hello flow choose the Intent menu Next click Create Intent 2 Input intent detail with name helloIntent Then turn on toggle As Initial to create a trigger in the chatbot and execute the hello flow 3 Next continue to choose the Text type Input a condition to make the chatbot execute the intent when the end user sends the message Hello or start content Hello content start 4 Click the Create button to finish creating intent Create a Transition Transition is a procedure to move from one state to another state if a condition is fulfilled Create transition by pulling a line from the source state to the destination state like the image below 1 In this step you will create a transition between the init state and the hello state by pulling a line If you succeed to create a transition it will show a form on the right screen 2 Then input condition detail to create transition can be executed if an end user input is caught by helloIntent intent intent helloIntent 3 Click the Save button to finish creating the transition Publish Bot This publish feature is useful to save changes in the form of revision numbers The Publish button can be found on all Flow pages 1 In this step you will save the created bot design Click the Publish button which is placed in the top right corner 2 To ensure your bot is stored correctly enter the Revision List menu The revision list will show every new revision at the top Testing Your Bot In this step you will try a simple chatbot using the emulator feature 1 On the lower right of your screen click on the Test Chatbot button You will see a small window with a chat conversation interface if you succeed 2 Type Hello word If your chatbot works well then it will show the chatbot reply witn created action This image is the correct example 3 Congratulations your first chatbot is done Next continue to deploy your chatbot in messaging platform Telegram Create a Deployment Deployment is a step to merge all Revisions in Flow NLU and CMS so that bots can be integrated into the channel Before starting channel integration chatbots must at least have 1 deployment 1 In the sidebar choose the Deploy menu Then choose Overview 2 Click the New Deployment button then it will show a form on the right screen 3 Choose the deployment version In Kata Platform there are 3 deployment versions Major to deploy big changes such as change chatbot use case Minor to deploy medium changes such as adding new features in your chatbot Patch to deploy small changes such as change copy in action 4 Then click the Submit button If deployment is successful then the interface will be shown like this Create an Environment Step after creating a deployment is to create an environment An environment is a zone in computer science that provides a place to run integrated applications Kata Platform has 3 environments development staging and production 1 Choose the menu Deploy then choose Environment 2 In this step you will create a Development environment Click the button Create Environment in the Development card 3 Fill in the environment then click Create Integration to a Channel Create a Channel In this step you will create a chatbot integration with the Telegram messaging platform Telegram is a free messaging platform to deploy chatbots with a simple setup 1 In the Deploy gt Environment click the Create Channel button 2 You will be redirected to the Create Channel page Click the Create Channel button to create a new channel 3 Fill in the channel name and choose type as Telegram To fill in the Bot User OAuth Access Token field we must set up a chatbot in Telegram first The next step is to open your Telegram application and log in Before you start you need a Telegram account already registered and logged in to your application Connect chatbot to Telegram 1 The first step is to register your bot to the BotFather account 2 Type newbot and BotFather will ask for your chatbot name Feel free to use any name you like 3 After that you will be asked to enter your chatbot username Remember that your bot username has to either start or end with bot 4 Once finished BotFather will respond with a bot token to access the Telegram Bot API 5 Go back to Platform then copy the bot access token into the channel drawer 6 Click Create to get a webhook from the Kata Platform Then click the copy button to copy the webhook URL 7 Click on the webhook link to View Channel detail It will show a drawer to copy the access token and webhook URL 8 Next open a new tab on your browser and enter this URL Change my_bot_token into your own bot token Also paste kata_platform_webhook_url with the copied webhook URL 9 Click Go or press Enter on the keyboard 10 If you see the message Webhook was set you re all set Let s try our chatbot Open Telegram on the desktop or mobile and start chatting with your bot This is the end of getting started with a chatbot You can contact support kata ai

      "contents": "Introduction Natural Language Understanding NLU is a computer s ability to transform a text message into a structured object In the Kata Platform NLU is a place for users to design and build their NLU capability for their conversational AI product How to Use This guide will teach you how to integrate NLU into your chatbot to recognize specific end users input Before you start you will need to create at least one entity 1 To create an entity go to the NLU menu Then click the Entity menu 2 Click Create Entity to set up a new entity It will show a form on the right screen Fill in the entity name 3 Inherit lets you copy an entity from any public NLU on the Kata Platform To inherit an NLU type the NLU ID with username project name Inherited entities will sync to the original entity including the labels and training data For example in the getting started chatbot kata platform documentation content start your first chatbot section your NLU ID format is muhfadhiilkata test_simple_bot 4 Type is intended for the entity type We have 3 entity types in the Kata Platform Trait is a text classifier to classify a sentence into a particular labels This type is suitable for making your bot recognize nuance in a sentence Dictionary is a word tagger which has keys and labels It will form an array The Phrase is a word tagger 5 The Profile is an AI model that is available to use by users Depending on data training and your dataset you can choose any profiles you want The default profile is suitable for many data samples so that this profile is available in all entity types intent profile is suitable for entity type trait default_v2 profile is our newest profile and is suitable if you have a large amount of data 6 Root enables you to create an entity using other users NLU to copy the training data and add new labels Therefore it is suitable if you have a trained NLU and want to add more labels in the NLU You can type an NLU ID which consists of username and project with format username project name 7 Labels are a feature to determine classes or categories from an entity To add a new label you can type and press enter on your keyboard If you choose entity type dictionary it will show a dropdown name Belongs to This feature enables you to define relationships between entities Belongs to feature can only be used for entities in the same NLU with entity type phrase or dictionary It is suitable if your data sample is like this Saya mau beli es kopi susu 2 dan less sugar Es kopi susu is the main menu 2 and less sugar are modifiers to detailing the order So in Belongs To concept you will tag 2 and choose belongsTo Training your NLU After creating an entity and labels you have to train them 1 Go to NLU gt Training menu 2 Then you will see 2 choices to train your entities Single training is a way to train sentences training data one by one Bulk training is a way to train up to 200 sentences training data by uploading a txt file with annotations inside the file These are steps to train your NLU using single training 1 For example to train 1 sentence for your NLU type a sentence then press enter on the keyboard to review the training For example Saya ingin membeli kopi susu 2 Next you can preview the sentence first and tag your entities You can block or double click in a word to tag a word Then it will show a dropdown to choose entities and labels in format entity name label name You can select a dropdown at the bottom of the entities list for tagging a sentence 3 Click the Train button to submit training data These are steps to train your NLU using bulk training 1 First open your text and source code editor Notepad notepad sublime 2 Create a new file 3 You will create training data using a simple syntax for entity type trait and for entity type phrase Example for entity type trait Saya mau pesan pizza intent order It means the sentence is classified into an entity named intent with the label order Example for entity type phrase and dictionary Saya mau pesan tiket ke destination Malang atas nama ner person Budi intent order It means the word Malang is tagged for entity name destination and Budi is tagged for entity name ner with label person 4 Save the following training data into training data example txt 5 Go to NLU gt Training in Platform Then click on the Bulk Training button 6 Click on the Browse button to open the file explorer finder or drag and drop the file into the browse file dialog 7 Wait for the upload process 8 After the upload is complete you can review the training data file in the Platform 9 Click on the Train button to train the data 10 You will see a customer satisfaction survey after using the feature Fill in the survey then click X to close the dialog 11 You have successfully trained your NLU with the uploaded data Every training will make your NLU smarter measured by a confidence score The confidence score is how the NLU recognizes end users input between 0 and 1 Test Your NLU You can test if your NLU is good enough or wrong in the Kata Platform by using the Test NLU feature These are the steps 1 Click the Test NLU button on the right bottom of your screen 2 Then it will show a chat window 3 Type in the chatbox a sentence to test your NLU The best practice is to prepare data training and data testing separately but they must have similarities When you enter a sentence or data testing a result is shown For example here is how to read the result from the test NLU example id abf78 input halo output kata product Intent type trait value bayar start 0 end 4 score 0 8116588592529297 label bayar Let s break them down 1 It is a sentence or word that you typed input halo 2 Two entities are not detected by your input halo so that the results are null output kata product 3 There is a detected entity called Intent and the entity type is trait Then start and end mean character count from hello Next score means a confidence score from the NL model to predict the sentence or word from end users Lastly the label labels under the entity that the word or sentence detected Intent type trait value bayar start 0 end 4 score 0 8116588592529297 label bayar Finally you understand the basics of creating NLU and how to train it Now let s improve your knowledge by following our advanced guidelines to design NLU and training it Advanced guidelines to design and train your NLU Designing NLU You can create NLU depending on your needs The more complex an NLU the larger training data is required to build it A few things you must consider when designing an NLU are 1 The total number of labels in an entity 2 NLU complexity impacts training process complexity as well 3 The total number of entities in an NLU An entity will have its model so the more entities you owned then the longer the training process In the next part you will learn several suggestions to reduce complexity and make the training process easier First suggestion Dividing entity type trait into a few entities If an entity has too many labels e g 50 labels it will require at least 50 training data Moreover you will need larger training data to reach a high prediction result score if sentences between labels are alike To help this problem you can break down labels from an entity into a few entities For example you have an entity type intent as follows NLU name nl 1 Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels lupa_pin ganti_pin kartu_hilang buku_tabungan_hilang ganti_kartu ganti_buku_tabungan buat_kartu cara_daftar_nasabah You can break down it into 2 differents entities as follows NLU name nl 2 First entity Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels lupa ganti ganti buat hilang Second Entity Entity name topic Entity type trait Entity profile topic Labels pin kartu buku_tabungan nasabah This method can increase your model prediction score by dividing the score into several groups of labels From the example above the first NLU nl 1 will divide the prediction score 1 00 into 8 different labels for the intent entity Otherwise the second NLU nl 2 will divide the prediction score 1 00 into 4 labels for the intent entity and 4 labels for the topic entity Important note This suggestion is recommended if you have limited training data If you have a large amount of training data or there are no problems with your current training data this suggestion is unnecessary Second suggestion Utilize profile intent Another tip is to use an intent profile which is influenced by predictions from other models type phrase or type dictionary This way can make the training process if training data is limited and sentences form alike Important note This suggestion applies to entity type trait with intent profile only First example given a training data dimana tempat perpanjang sim paling dekat ask_nearby_simstnk dimana tempat perpanjang stnk sekitar sini ask_nearby_simstnk dimana kantor polisi terdekat ask_nearby_polisi And you have an NLU with the detail as follows NLU name nl v1 Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_nearby_simstnk ask_nearby_polisi This NLU can be changed into NLU name nl v2 First entity Entity name simstnk Entity type dict Entity profile default Key sim Labels sim surat izin mengemudi Key stnk Labels stnk surat tanda kendaraan bermotor Second entity Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_nearby_simstnk ask_nearby_polisi NLU nl v2 will make the training process faster because the words sim and stnk are in one similar category which is simstnk However there is a case that you need to be aware of An intent profile can remove the detailed information Here is an example The second example given training data resep untuk membuat pizza bbq apa ya ask_bbq_recipe pizza pepperoni gimana cara buatnya ya ask_pepperoni_recipe kasih tau dong resep pizza aas buatanmu ask_aas_recipe Then you will have an NLU NLU name nl v1 Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_bbq_recipe ask_pepperoni_recipe ask_aas_recipe Next you change the NLU structure into this NLU name nl v2 First entity Entity name pizza Entity type dict Entity profile default Key bbq Labels bbq barbeque Key pepperoni Labels pepperoni peperoni Key aas Labels aas american all star Second entity Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_bbq_recipe ask_pepperoni_recipe ask_aas_recipe The intent entity in nlu v1 can recognize the differentiation between labels Otherwise nl v2 cannot acknowledge it because bbq pepperoni and aas are set up as one category pizza If users input a sentence resep buat bbq apa ya the score will show the same results from all labels If you still want to use dictionary type for this second example you can try this way NLU name nl v3 First entity Entity name pizza Entity type dict Entity profile default Key bbq Labels bbq barbeque Key pepperoni Labels pepperoni peperoni Key aas Labels aas american all star Second entity Entity name intent Entity type trait Entity profile intent Labels ask_pizza_recipe The nl v3 can recognize a sentence has ask_pizza_recipe intent and can specify which pizza by using pizza entity This method is helpful to make your bot easy to understand limited words such as product names Otherwise this suggestion is not recommended if you re using generic words Third suggestion Dividing NLU A bot can have multiple NLU Here are a few cases in which NLU can be divided Use specific NLU for certain flows Some flows in a bot may have a particular NLU for a flow which means input to trigger the flow is different from other flows This way can reduce the number of listed labels in an entity and ease the prediction process Examples Using credential NLU which is executed when the user first interacts with the bot Using order NLU in commerce bot will be executed when the user chooses the order menu Use specific NLU for certain states Few states in a bot may have similar input but have different meanings depending on what states are running You can configure the NLU in state condition Examples YesNo NLU can be used in overall flows but shall be specified in states that require end users confirmation Note You can use these methods if you have too many labels data between labels are alike a limited number of training data predictions result is not optimal yet or found other problems But if your NLU is fine you can create an entity with many labels Training Guideline The training process is required to make a bot response to end users messages and requires training data In NLU a training process will also train all models read entities For example NLU A has entity 1 entity 2 and entity 3 Because each entity owns its models NLU A has 3 models that run individually If you input training data for NLU A you train entity 1 entity 2 and entity 3 models Here are suggestions that you need to consider in the training process Add various forms of language Input training data with various forms such as formal informal slang long or short sentences If you only train a form e g formal then the model may understand formal sentences Avoid imbalanced data between labels The imbalanced data affect bias between labels A small amount of imbalanced data is not a problem However if you have a large amount of imbalanced data the predictions result too significant on specific labels and a bias Add counter training Counter training means you input training data that is not classified to current labels For example You have an entity that can predict book genres into 3 categories read labels horror fiction and biography Each label has been trained and can recognize each genre Then an input is entered with a new category named history Because the model only distinguishes between the 3 labels and assumes that each book must be categorized into 3 labels the model cannot answer not all three or none To make the model understand history input you have to enter training data without giving any intent tags Add a new label to the trained entity If you want to add a new label train the label with a similar total amount of training with current labels For example You have an entity with 5 labels Each label has 10 training data Then you add a new label Your next step will be to train the label equal to or more than 10 training data The final step is to train the other 5 labels with a few training data Ambiguous data Avoid preparing ambiguous training data into different labels Ambiguous data means you input the same training data but the context depends on what end users asked For example End user sends the word sudah if your bot asks a question about apakah sudah makan Smalltalk flow or apakah sudah menikah Credential flow Both sentences can be recognized as intent doneEating read entity intent with label doneEating or intent married read entity intent with label married To reduce this ambiguity case you shall prepare training data as follows Input training data such as sudah menikah in intent married There is an additional word menikah that could distinguish the labels For the word sudah train it to a different label such as intent done For the bot implementation you shall put a condition intent done for states executed when end users said sudah word Relationship between bot NL and training process Bot development used NL in bot and training process is influencing each other Bot implementation can process some limitations encountered in NL results through the bot NL complexity is affected by bot complexity So the more complex a bot the more complex the NL will be and the more training data For NL it is possible to mispredict a few data It is a usual case You can solve this by adding training data or post processing in the bot This is the end of the guidance You can contact support kata ai if you have any difficulties when implementing this",

      "contents": "What is Bulk Training Great NL models are a fundamental part of making a great chatbot and approximately 70 of all chatbot projects use NL models instead of a keyword based approach based on our Kata ai projects data Previously the bulk training process was very technical because developers needed to use KataCLI and view the results on the Platform GUI This back and forth switching of tools was required to do training Now you can use the new Bulk Training on the Platform GUI itself to train more than 200 sentences training data at once These are the screenshots of our newest feature You can click on this video tutorial or go to the NLU gt Training menu check the screenshot below How Bulk Training Might Help You Training NL models is one of the most time consuming processes in chatbot development which could take approximately 6 weeks On average a complex chatbot project requires 1 000 data for their NL models It s not ideal to train the sentences one by one as a typical 1 000 sentence NL model would easily take more than 4 hours to train Hence bulk training can significantly reduce the training effort with a simplified user flow How to Use Bulk Training Create a Project Mission Create a new project Prerequisite You already have a Platform account and have logged in 1 Click on the Create Project button 2 Fill in the required fields for the project 3

means state definitions actions Dict which means action definitions methods Dict which means Flow specific method definitions Additionally a flow can be set as following active boolean which means you can enable disable a flow by setting the active field of a flow volatile boolean which means you can set it to true then it will close the flow whenever it s outside the flow expire number which means it will set flow to expire after a specified number of milliseconds Building an intent Intent can be defined as following intents The intent description contains following fields type text command data which is to define type of the message to be associated with this intent condition string string which is condition filter to rule out certain intents to be selected classifier Classifier Classifier which is classifier definition attributes Dict which is attributes slot filling associated with the intent fallback boolean which means define intent as fallback intent priority number which means set priority of an intent for the selection process initial boolean which means set whether intent can be triggered only in current flow or from other flow as well Defining condition Condition is every valid javascript expression returning a boolean Available variables are type string which is a message type payload JsonObject which means message payload content string which means message content context JsonObject which means flow context data JsonObject which means session data config JsonObject which means bot config Example condition type text amp amp content hello amp amp context completed Building classifier Classifier consists of following fields nlu string which means name of defined NLU or NLU type hint string which means prepend message with a text fragment match string which means match the result of the classifier with a specific string options JsonObject which means override NLU options process method method which means postprocess intent using methods

someAction Building transition Transition define condition that leads to moving from one state to the other state A transition is defined as following transitions \t Field definition condition string which means condition that trigger the transition priority number which means priority for transition selection fallback boolean which means define fallback when no other transition matches mapping Mapping method which means define mapping or method that is triggered during this transition Example transitions \t askDob \t\tcondition intent yes amp amp context personGender amp amp context

transition The system will automatically attach this transition in every state float Defining events We can define a mapping or method that is triggered during these events enter which means this event is triggered when entering a state transit which means this event is triggered before transition process exit which means this event is triggered after transition process Building Meta Context Additional meta context accessible in states at context start boolean which means true if state is initial state to string which means describe destination state Available during exit from string

attribute features You can add more than 1 NLUs Then it enables the intent to check all NLUs 3 Then NLUs will check the threshold The threshold can act as a confidence level and these values range from 0 0 completely uncertain to 1 0 completely confident This confidence level is usually set between 0 7 to 0 8 Finally NLUs will check whether the confidence score from the incoming message is lower or higher than the threshold If an incoming message is lower than the threshold NLUs will send bot information that the incoming message is incorrect with what NLU had recognized Then the intent will be checked by other NLUs If an incoming message is equal to or higher than the threshold NLUs will send information that the condition is correct 4 If NLUs condition has matched then intent will send information to a bot that incoming message from the end user is recognized as intent yesNL for example 5 Then the bot will check the following action if an intent condition has been fulfilled For example if the transition has condition intent yesNL then the bot will execute the next state connected between the transition Check the image below for more detail How to Use To integrate NLU can be implemented in chatbot these are the steps 1 First in the Kata Platform go to the Flow menu Then click the NLUs menu in the sidebar 2 Click on the Create NLU button Then it will show a form on the right screen 3 Fill in NLUs name and choose an NLU Type For this guide you will select NL 4 On the NLU ID search and dropdown you will search your NLU to integrate it into your chatbot NLU ID consists of username and project with format username project name For example in the getting started chatbot section kata platform documentation content start your first chatbot your NLU ID format is muhfadhiilkata test_simple_bot You can use NLU ID from another project as long as the project is set as public 5 Threshold can act as a confidence level and these values range from 0 0 completely uncertain to 1 0 completely confident This confidence level is usually set between 0 7 to 0 8 So the data that falls under 0 7 0 8 will not be detected by the bot The field only allows numbers and decimals to separate using the character 6 As Intent is a feature to collect available labels in the NLU The field only allows alphanumerics 7 Output has several output types depending on the entity type you used Output Types Functionals Raw Use this output type if your entity type is trait It will result in raw sentences Dictionary Use this output type if your entity type is dictionary It will result in an array consisting of keys and labels Phrase Using supermodel kata entity you must use this output type 8 Path is a feature to support integration with Supermodel 9 Click Create to finish your NLUs For example you must integrate an NLU ID muhfadhiilkata test_simple_bot which has 1 entity name topic and entity type is trait to an intent named topic The entity topic has 2 labels FAQ order and buy The first step is you will fill in the NLUs form as follows NLU Name topic nl NLU Type NL NLU ID muhfadhiilkata test_simple_bot Threshold 0 8 As Intent topic Output Raw Next you will define this NLU inside an intent So you will create an intent named topic 1 Go to the Conversation Flows menu then click on the Intent tab 2 Click the Create Intent button Then a form will show on the right screen 3 In Intent Type choose Text to start setup 4 Next click the button Add classifier This feature enables you to insert your NLUs inside the intent so intent can match whether end user input is understandable by the NLU or not First there is a dropdown to choose available NLUs then select topic nl 5 Then click the button Add attribute This feature enables you to insert your NLUs inside the intent similar to the Add Classifier feature with differentiation that bot developers can create a condition in the state or transition by using the entity s label It is because an attribute is a variable that has an array form 6 Click Create to create an intent Test Your Chatbot 1 To test your chatbot you can see it in the bottom right corner of your screen 2 Click the Test Chatbot to start 3 Type a sentence or word 4 You can see incoming messages that you typed blue color and bot response white color by clicking the eye icon under the message bubble Here is how to read the incoming message type means message source which is from the emulator owner means the account that typed the message For outgoing messages or bot responses here is how to read them type means executed action type For this example it uses a text action type content means your message to test the bot action means executed action name flow means executed flow name intent means which intent recognized your message This is the end of the guidance You can contact support kata ai if you have any difficulties when implementing this",

      "contents": "Introduction Training Data Generator is a feature that enables you to automatically generate training data up to 100 data using sentence samples or we call it data samples Before creating a data sample you will need to define the keyword and synonyms inside the word bank feature Why is it required We do permutations from data samples and keyword variants to generate the training data Let s try a case 1 You create a word bank from Kenapa which consists of variant words or synonyms from Kenapa For example knp ngap ngaps kenaps So you have 4 word variants 2 Next you create a data sample For example Kenapa ATM saya bermasalah ya 3 We will create a permutation or combination from a data sample with variant words For example expected generated data will be like this knp ATM saya bermasalah ngap ATM saya bermasalah ATM saya bermasalah ngaps kenaps ATM saya bermasalah And many more 4 Also we have a feature that is bulk tagging to tag all generated training data with your available entities and labels It enables faster tagging rather than manually annotating This guidance will elaborate on how to use training data generators and do bulk tagging after generated data shows up Let s get started Create Entity and Labels Before you start you will need to create at least one entity 1 To create an entity go to the NLU gt Models menu Then click the Entity menu 2 Click Create Entity to set up a new entity It will show a form on the right screen Fill in the entity name Here is the explanation of each field 1 Inherit lets you copy an entity from any public NLU on the Kata Platform To inherit an NLU simply type the NLU ID with username project name Inherited entities will sync to the original entity including the labels and training data For example in the getting started chatbot section kata platform documentation content start your first chatbot your NLU ID format is muhfadhiilkata test_simple_bot 2 Type is intended for the entity type In Kata Platform we have 3 entity types which are Trait is a text classifier that classifies a sentence into particular labels This type is suitable for making your bot recognize nuance in a sentence Dictionary is a word tagger which has keys and labels It will form an array The Phrase is a word tagger 3 The Profile is an AI model that is available to use by users You can choose any profiles you want depending on data training and the dataset you have The default profile is suitable for a large number of data samples so that this profile is available in all entity types intent profile is suitable for entity type trait default_v2 profile is our newest profile and is suitable if you have a large amount of data 4 Root enables you to create an entity using other users NLU to copy the training data and add new labels Therefore it is suitable if you have a trained NLU and want to add more labels in the NLU To use this you can type an NLU ID which consists of username and project with format username project name 5 Labels is a feature to determine classes or categories from an entity To add a new label you can type and press enter on your keyboard 6 If you choose entity type dictionary it will show a dropdown name Belongs to This feature enables you to define relationships between entities Belongs to feature can only be used for entities in the same NLU with entity type phrase or dictionary It is suitable if your data sample is like this Saya mau beli es kopi susu 2 dan less sugar Es kopi susu is the main menu 2 and less sugar are modifiers to detailing the order So in Belongs To concept you will tag 2 and choose belongsTo For this guide you will create 1 entity type trait to extract sentences 1 entity type phrase and 1 entity type dictionary to extract words 1 Click the Create Entity button 2 Then fill in as follows for the first entity Name intent Type Trait Label statement Here is the screenshot 3 Click the Create Entity button to create the following entity 4 Fill in as follows for the second entity Name object Type phrase Label person Here is the screenshot 5 Fill in as follows for the last entity Name things Type dictionary Key car Labels suv van lcgc Here is the screenshot 6 Click Create to finalize The next step is to create a word bank when you re done Create a Word Bank In this part you will create synonyms or variants from the keyword Here is the guidance for adding variants You can add 2 words as 1 variant by using space Maximum 20 characters You must create at least 2 variants to create a word bank with a maximum of 20 characters for each variant You can remove a variant by clicking the x button next to the word Step by step to create a word bank 1 Click the Word Bank tab then click the Create button It will show a dialog 2 Fill in the name for your word bank For example you can fill in Kenapa 3 Then create variants by typing a synonym from Kenapa word For example ngaps ngapa kenp knp kenopo 4 Press Enter on your keyboard 5 Finally you have variants Then click the Create button to create a word bank Create a Data Sample Once you ve created a word bank now you re ready to make a data sample Data sample is a sample sentence that consists of a word bank and several words as a base to generate training data or called a pattern Here are the steps 1 Go to NLU gt Training 2 Click on Bulk Training dropdown then choose Data Generator 3 You will see a row to input a data sample For example to add your available word bank type to show the word bank list 4 Input a data sample for example Kenapa kemarin Sinta tidak sekolah 5 Press Add Row to submit 6 You can edit or delete your data sample after it has been created On the data sample page there is information Total data possibilities mean total generated data that can be created from available data samples So for this example you have 2 data samples multiplied with 1 word bank then multiply again with 5 word variants So finally there will be 10 data possibilities Data to Generate is several generated data that you wanted The number must be below or equal to the total data possibilities Important note Make sure you put a space before the next word or after the previous word Example Kenapa Sinta tidak sekolah or Aku lagi Kenapa ya hari ini Generate Training Data This step will guide you to generate training data from created data samples Generated training data might not match your expectations because we are duplicating words However you can prepare the training data and do bulk training instead if you want specific training data Learn more about bulk training 1 Before you start ensure your data samples are created The generate button will enable if data samples are available and data to generate is equal to or below the total data possibilities 2 Let s put 10 data to generate 3 Click the Generate button on the top right of your screen 4 It redirects you to the Generated Data page where you can train using the bulk labeling feature 5 You will see a training data list as follows 6 You can delete generated data by clicking on the remove button in the list Bulk labeling You re going to train generated data by using bulk labeling Bulk labeling is a feature to tag entity type trait phrase or dictionary by doing it at once Let s start to tag an entity type trait that you ve created before 1 In the Bulk Labeling section select the entity name intent This entity type is trait 2 Next it will show available labels in the entity Because you only create 1 label then select the statement label Important note Bulk labeling for entity type trait will tag all generated data 3 Click the button Add more entity Then select the entity name object 4 Next select the person label Then it will show a text area named Words to Tag Words to Tag is a feature to search words you want to tag For example you will tag sinta word 5 Press Enter on your keyboard to submit the word It will show like this Important note Bulk labeling for entity type phrase and dictionary will tag words only 6 Then add the entity dictionary type Click Add more Entity to start Then select entity name things Then it will show a text area named Words to Tag Words to Tag is a feature to search words you want to tag For example you will tag a sekolah word Important note Bulk labeling for entity type dictionary will not show specific labels to tag So it will train the entity 7 Finally you can click the button Train It will train all generated data into entity intent with statement label and entity object with person label 8 When successfully trained you will redirect to the Training page On this page you can see the generated data has been trained 9 You can click the arrow on the right of the box to open the trained data detail Limitations There are several important notes when using a data generator such as You can create unlimited data samples and word banks but the system only generates up to 100 training data You can create data again if you want to add more than 100 generated training data or sentences It recommended using new data samples when generating new training data to make similar combination training data or sentence results If you re not satisfied with generated training data we recommend these approaches Create a new data sample with a different pattern from previous data samples If you want a specific sentence but the system does not show what you want then we recommend you to use the training feature in NLU gt Training instead If you have another NLU and want to use word banks or data samples from the current project it cannot be done now The bulk labeling feature is only for the Data Generator feature You cannot use it for now independently This is the end of the guidance You can contact support kata ai

      "contents": "Introduction Building a chatbot on Kata Platform is quick and easy even with a lack of programming knowledge In this tutorial we will learn how to create a simple bot on LINE Messenger to order a pizza We will also learn how to train your bot with NL Studio Let s start by looking at this bot diagram or commonly called conversation tree Conversation tree is an overview of chatbot functionalities In this conversation tree we break down the process of ordering pizza and the types of bot action we want to use on each state Sign up to Kata Platform Create an account on Kata Platform to start building chatbot On your browser open and click Sign Up Then fill the form with a username an email and an account type Continue by clicking Sign Up You will get a confirmation email once our team has verified your account You may follow the instructions provided in the confirmation email to activate and start using your account Create a Project Login to Kata Platform On your browser open platform kata ai login and enter your username amp password Click Login to continue Create a project After you logged in you will be taken to the Project Page Click on Create Project and fill in the form Each project contains one bot design one NL and one CMS NLU language is used to determine which language model you want to use Currently we support Bahasa Indonesia and English You can also choose NLU Visibility to be public or private If you choose public all Kata Platform users can utilize your NLU using root and inherit function Create Fallback Flow Create fallback flow Once you create a project you will be redirected to the Bot Studio menu Now we are going to learn how to create a flow Flow is a container of intent state and action A flow typically represents a linear process The first flow that we will create is a Fallback Flow Its purpose is to handle undefined users input or commonly called else condition state In this case the else condition is everything that is not Start Order You may find a flow that is created automatically by the system or default flow We will delete that flow by pressing more button and then Delete Next click Create Flow button to create fallback flow Set flow to active persistent and default Create fallback intent After you have created fallback flow we will create new intent by pressing the Intents tab on the sub menu Then we will create a new intent for fallback flow Click Create Intent button to create Then fill in the form as follows Create State init Next we will create a state called init Click the button at the bottom right of your screen Fill state with name init on Overview tab and set it to initial state and end state as shown below Enabling Initial State and End State will make init the first and the last flow to be checked by the bot when there isn t any flow that matches a user s input Now we will create a bot response to display an apology message Click Add actions button to create a response Container for creating action will appear Create Action Text in State init Click on button to create a new action Choose action type Text Then fill in the form Click on Create Action
