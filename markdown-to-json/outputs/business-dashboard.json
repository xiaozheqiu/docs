      "contents": "Starting February 1 2022 WhatsApp will switch from a notification based pricing model to a conversation based pricing model Businesses will no longer be charged for sent notifications instead they will be charged per conversation See how it works below for more information Terms amp Definitions Conversation A session that occurs between businesses and users within 1x24 hours Conversation via WhatsApp can be initiated by both businesses and users User Initiated Conversation A conversation initiated by a user to a business This session starts when the business responds to the first message from a customer within 1x24 hours either using an automated chatbot or an agent manually via the omnichannel dashboard If the business replies to messages more than 1x24 hours from the user s first message then the session will be considered a Business Initiated Conversation Business Initiated Conversation A conversation initiated by a business to a user usually in the form of a notification template message formerly known as a Template Message or a message used to follow up on a User Initiated Conversation that has lasted more than 1x24 hours This session will be open for 1x24 hours starting from the first message sent by the business and in that session the business is only charged for one session even if it sends more than one message template Kata Business Dashboard Product of Kata ai for WhatsApp Business Platform management formerly called WhatsApp Business API WABA Businesses can register purchase credit independently as well as perform uses such as number verification submission and sending of template messages and monitoring usage of purchased credits Credit Represents the right to a number of conversations that are paid in advance in the form of pulses in the amount of Rupiah currency which can be reduced by the unit price of User Initiated Conversations and or Business Initiated Conversations Top Up Credit a system of adding credit in bulk or wholesale paid in advance Top Up Pricing Tier Fee structuring system for top up credit where purchases with a larger value will get a bigger discount How It Works WhatsApp Business API conversations fall into two different priced categories 1 User initiated such as customer service and general inquiries Inbound 2 Business initiated such as notifications and notifications Outbound All conversations or Conversations are measured in 24 hour increments also known as Sessions which start each time the first message is delivered by the business The first message can be a response to a user question or a business initiated message template that is being delivered Charges for conversations are based on the end user s phone number Rates for business initiated and user initiated conversations vary by market country or region See Rates for specific pricing information The first 1 000 conversations each month will be free so your business can start building experiences your customers will love before they have to pay In addition conversations will not be charged when a user sends a message to a business using the call to action button on an Ad that clicks into WhatsApp or a Facebook Page CTA Scenarios Disclaimer This scenario is based on The Official Facebook documentation The complete scenario can be found here For the following scenarios we will use a user named Anne Budianto a Commercial Air airline customer and Kicks an online shoe retailer Anne prefers to use WhatsApp to message businesses as it is the fastest way to get the support and information she needs Commercial Air and Kicks know that many of their customers prefer to connect via WhatsApp so they are ready to answer questions or send important updates via message 1 User Initiated Conversation UIC Scenario 1 User customer service or general support questions in one 24 hour conversation session 1 Our user Anne Budianto messaged Commercial Air with a question about an upcoming reservation When a Commercial Air reply message is sent a 24 hour conversation session will start 2 In this scenario all additional messages are free within a 24 hour session This encourages Commercial Air to follow up with support questions in a timely manner while giving users the ability to exchange as many messages as needed to resolve issues in a 24 hour session 3 If Commercial Air continues to exchange messages with Anne after the initial 24 hour conversation session has ended they will be charged for the new conversation They will also be asked to send a message template to start a new conversation if it has been more than 24 hours since Anne s last message which will be charged as a business initiated conversation In this scenario Anne gets the info she needs about her reservation and Commercial Air pays for a single user initiated conversation Cost IDR 320 for 1 UIC Scenario 2 A user customer initiated conversation that leads to two conversations with a Message Template 1 Anne wanted to check on an order she had made with Kicks an online shoe retailer He did it at 13 13 2 Kicks have a bot set up to reply to basic order inquiries and respond to Anne with delivery details at 13 13 3 As a follow up the next day the Kicks bot notified Anne that her order had shipped at 3 45 p m In this scenario Kicks pays for one user initiated conversation and one business initiated conversation Cost IDR 820 for 1 UIC amp 1 BIC 2 Business Initiated Conversation UIC Scenario 3 Business initiates sending notification messages using Message Templates 1 When a flight is delayed or its status changes Commercial Air notifies customers who have chosen to receive notifications using message templates 2 Two message templates sent in one 24 hour conversation session result in one business initiated conversation fee In this scenario Commercial Air wants to inform Anne that her flight is delayed by 30 minutes Commercial Air will charge for one business initiated conversation for sending these two message templates to Anne in a 24 hour conversation session Cost IDR 500 for 1 BIC Scenario 4 The business initiates a conversation that leads to a two way conversation with the user customer 1 When a customer places a new order from Kicks the online retailer sends a text message to confirm the order has been received and asks the customer if they would like to receive a notification when the order is shipped 2 The customer selects Yes and chooses to receive additional order notifications In this scenario Kicks pays for one conversation initiated by the business If the user replies more than 24 hours after sending the initial business message and is followed by a business reply it will result in a new conversation initiated by the user Cost a IDR 500 for 1 BIC if the user does not reply to the message b IDR 500 for 1 BIC if the user replies within 1x24 hours c IDR 820 for 1 BIC amp 1 UIC if the user replies after 1x24 hours These are four common conversation scenarios between businesses and users If you still have questions regarding the comparison of the scenarios above not limited to other possibilities that can occur between business and user conversations please contact the Kata ai team to discuss it further Pricing The pricing scheme continues to use the credit system with a top up in bulk Imagine buying a prepaid cell phone number that will be reduced by Business Initiated Conversation and or User Initiated Conversation according to the number of conversations initiated by businesses and users Don t worry because no major changes have occurred We only convert credit purchases that previously used the number of messages to be sent into Rupiah currency values that can be used for the existing types of conversations The tiering system still applies the more credits you buy the bigger the discount you get To accommodate changes in pricing schemes that occur said the Business Dashboard to be updated to make it easier to use and monitor credit and the amount of usage The latest update will be released on February 1 2022 along with the price changes of the WhatsApp Business API 1 IDR for Indonesian

before ramping up volumes 4 Monitor quality metrics like phone level quality scores green yellow red available in the Business Manager UI and via API",
