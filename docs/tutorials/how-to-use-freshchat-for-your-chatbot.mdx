## How to generate API Token

1. First of all, you need to sign in to your **Freshworks** account to do the integration.
2. After you’re logged in, go to the **Settings** page to configure the API Token and Webhook.

3. In order to generate the API Token in Freshchat, go to **Settings → API** Tokens.

Next step is to paste the API token from Freshchat to the Kata Platform.

1. Go back to Kata Platform (<a href="https://platform.kata.ai" target="_blank"><span>http</span>s://platform.kata.ai</a>)
2. Paste the API Token there. Here is the example:

Let’s continue to get an Actor ID.

## How to generate Actor ID

1. Go to **Settings → Team** Members.
2. Then, click on the **Add a team member** button. In the “Roles” field, choose “Agent”.

  alt="How to use Freshchat for your chatbot"
  naturalHeight={900}
  naturalWidth={1600}
/>

3. With the API Token we got from the previous step, get the Actor ID using <a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank">Postman</a> or cURL. Actor ID is the agent `id`.

```
curl --request GET 'https://api.freshchat.com/v2/agents' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

4. Copy one of the Agent IDs, then paste it to the Kata Platform.

  naturalWidth={1600}
/>

## Finalize Freshchat set up

1. Go back to Freshchat, then go to **Settings → Webhooks**.
2. Turn on the webhook toggle which is placed in the top right.
3. Then, paste the webhook URL in the **Webhook** field.
4. Next, fill in a valid email address in the **Failure Notifications** field. It will enable you to receive the notification whenever there is a failure in the integration. Here is the example:

<FigureImage
  caption={{ title: 'Figure 11', description: `Set up webhook URL` }}

  naturalWidth={1600}
/>

5. Finally, click on the **Save** button.

It works! You can now share your newly created chatbot with your friends.

Freshchat also has an agent handover feature. It is useful for creating a seamless engagement experience for your customer to interact with your agent to meet their needs. The agent handover flow is:

1. End-users start a conversation with a chatbot.
2. In the beginning or middle of a conversation, the end-user may request to be connected with any human-agents.
3. Chatbot function will be paused if there’s an available agent. If there are none, chatbot will notify the user to make another request after a few minutes.

This is the end of the guidance, you can contact support@kata.ai if you have any difficulties when implementing this.
