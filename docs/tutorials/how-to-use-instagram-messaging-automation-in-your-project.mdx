### Instagram Story Mention

#### About

Whenever your customers mention your account in their Instagram Story, you can send automated replies to their DM.

<div className="info">
  <img className="borderless" src="/assets/images/icon-info.svg" />
  <p>
    Important note:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Because Instagram Story will be deleted every 24 hours, it is expected that the story attachments will disappear
        too.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chatbots cannot “read” the Instagram Story Mention content, but human agents can see the attachment. <br />
        Tips: If your customers mention your account in the complaint context and your chatbot cannot satisfy them with the
        solutions, the agent can take over the conversation.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>

#### How to Use

1. Go to the Kata Platform and select your project.
2. Click to **Flow > Conversation Flow > Intent > Create Intent.**

#### Sending Ice Breaker Reply

We probably felt confused the first time using a chatbot as end-users, especially if the bot hasn’t given apparent bot features. “Ice Breaker” solves this problem by showing a _getting started_ on a few topics after the end-user adds the brand’s account.

<div className="info">
  <img className="borderless" src="/assets/images/icon-info.svg" />
  <p>Important: Ice Breaker is only shown for a first-time chat.</p>
</div>

Here is the screenshot of the feature

<FigureImage
  caption={{ title: 'Figure 4', description: `Ice breaker in Instagram app.` }}
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/how-to-use-instagram-messaging-automation-in-your-project/image4.webp"
  alt="How to use Instagram Messaging automation in your project"
  naturalHeight={1600}
  naturalWidth={900}
/>

##### How to Use

Ice Breaker setup must be done in [Omnichat](/kata-omnichat/introduction/what-is-kata-omnichat). Hence, we need to create an Inbox and connect it to Instagram DM. Follow this tutorial on [how to create an Inbox](/kata-omnichat/getting-started/connect-your-instagram-messaging-inbox).

Finally, you’ve successfully created the Inbox. Let's jump to [creating the Ice Breaker tutorial](/kata-omnichat/manage-inbox-settings/set-up-ice-breaker).

#### Instagram Sticker (“like heart”)

This feature allows your bot to send a sticker heart ❤️ and it is different from inline-like.

<div className="info">
  <img className="borderless" src="/assets/images/icon-info.svg" />
  <p>
    Tips: To develop this feature, you should know that your bot will reply with a “heart” whatever the customers ask.
    It’s somehow uncomfortable if your customer complains to your bot, then it shows a heart sticker.
  </p>
</div>

##### How to Use

1. Go to the Kata Platform and select your project.
2. Click to **Flow > Conversation Flow > State > Action List**.
3. Choose **Instagram Sticker.**
4. Click **Create**.

## FAQ

#### I have 2 IGDM bot actions: image type and text type. The first response will show an image, then a text. However, after I deploy the IG channel, it offers a text, then an image. Why did it happen?

A: Because the API calls limit in Instagram (Facebook policy link) has a maximum of 5 outgoing messages in 1 second. Hence, loading the image and showing it to the end-user took a delay in between, and the impacted image action type didn’t show in the correct order. You cannot avoid it. We suggest you put a good UX conversation to display the image between text since the image will have an incorrect order than the Platform emulator.

It is the end of the guidance. You can contact [support@kata.ai](mailto:support@kata.ai) if you have any difficulties when implementing this.
