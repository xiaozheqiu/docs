LINE is a free messaging platform and is famous in Indonesia. This messaging platform supports various interactive action types such as carousel, button, Image Map, and many more.

This tutorial will learn how to deploy your chatbot to LINE. Let’s start.

## Create a deployment

Deployment is a step to merge all Revisions in Flow, NLU, and CMS so that you can integrate bots into the channel. Before starting channel integration, chatbots must at least have 1 deployment.

1. In the sidebar, choose the **Deploy** menu. Then, select **Overview**.

2. Click the **New Deployment** button. Then it will show a form on the right screen.

3. Choose the deployment version. In the Kata Platform, there are 3 deployment versions which are:

- Major to deploy significant changes, such as change chatbot use-case.

- Minor to deploy medium changes, such as adding new features in your chatbot.

- Patch to deploy small changes, such as change copy in action.

The step after creating a deployment is to create an environment. An environment is a zone in computer science that provides a place to run integrated applications. For example, Kata Platform has 3 environments: development, staging, and production.

1. Choose the menu **Deploy**, then choose **Environment**.
