## Introduction

In [Bot studio tutorial](/tutorials/bot-studio/), we learned how to make keyword-based chatbot to order pizza. However, keyword-based chatbot is not so smart. In this tutorial we will learn how to enhance the chatbot using NL Studio.

## Creating a NL Model with NL Studio

### Login to Kata | platform

Login to Kata | Platform by entering your username and password.

<FigureImage

  alt="nlst-1"
  naturalHeight={1050}
  naturalWidth={878}
/>

Click Login to continue

### Create Entity Label

After you entered to Kata Platform, click on the project you've created

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-2.webp"
  alt="nlst-2"
  naturalHeight={501}
  naturalWidth={1919}
/>

Then, click on NLU on the side bar

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-3.webp"
  alt="nlst-3"
  naturalHeight={557}
  naturalWidth={1088}
/>

Next, click Create Entity. Entity has similar definition with NL Model. It will help us to classify every input from users.

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-4.webp"
  alt="nlst-4"
  naturalHeight={596}
  naturalWidth={1833}
/>

Now, create an entity called `intent` that with 4 labels: `order`, `askOptions`, `confirm` and `cancel`. Further explanation about entity is explained in [NL Studio Docs](https://docs.kata.ai/nl-studio/nlu/)

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-5.webp"
  alt="nlst-5"
  naturalHeight={1188}
  naturalWidth={828}
/>

### Create Entity Type

In this entity `type`, we will create an entity with dictionary type (further explanation about entity dictionary type is explained in [NL Studio Docs](https://docs.kata.ai/nl-studio/nlu/)). This entity will handle pizza type selection. Add new entity and fill in the data as follows

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-6.webp"
  alt="nlst-6"
  naturalHeight={1612}
  naturalWidth={832}
/>

Then, continue filling the dictionary by adding other types

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-7.webp"
  alt="nlst-7"
  naturalHeight={1558}
  naturalWidth={824}
/>

### Create Entity Size

Entity `size` is used to handle pizzas size. In this entity, we will use `Belongs to` feature which binds an entity under another entity (further explanation about belongsTo usage is explained in [NL Studio Docs](https://docs.kata.ai/nl-studio/nlu/)). We will put entity `size` under entity `type`.

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-8.webp"
  alt="nlst-8"
  naturalHeight={1076}
  naturalWidth={808}
/>

In dictionary section, enter a keyword as a prediction for input from users

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-9.webp"
  alt="nlst-9"
  naturalHeight={1342}
  naturalWidth={842}
/>

### Create Entity Crust

Next, we will create an entity named `crust` to find out crust type on pizza. We'll put it under entity `type`.

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-10.webp"
  alt="nlst-10"
  naturalHeight={928}
  naturalWidth={1531}
/>

Enter the data as follows

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-11.webp"
  alt="nlst-11"
  naturalHeight={1332}
  naturalWidth={856}
/>

### Create Entity Qty

In pizza chatbot which we created earlier, user must enter pizza number to purchase using regex (regular expression.)

Entity `qty` will use dictionary by entering numbers or keywords related to the number of pizzas ordered. Add entity then fill in the form as follows

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-12.webp"
  alt="nlst-12"
  naturalHeight={943}
  naturalWidth={1907}
/>

Then, fill in as below

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-13.webp"
  alt="nlst-13"
  naturalHeight={1342}
  naturalWidth={846}
/>

After you've created entities, try to train data using your defined entities.

### Training Your Model

To start training, enter Training menu under NLU

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-14.webp"
  alt="nlst-14"
  naturalHeight={405}
  naturalWidth={1006}
/>

Enter a simple phrase like "want pizza" and press "enter" on your keyboard

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-15.webp"
  alt="nlst-15"
  naturalHeight={600}
  naturalWidth={1076}
/>

Then, in this section you can start tagging and classifying text. Click on Add Trait, then select `intent: order`.

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-16.webp"
  alt="nlst-16"
  naturalHeight={678}
  naturalWidth={1086}
/>

Click Train to submit your dataset.

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-17.webp"
  alt="nlst-17"
  naturalHeight={498}
  naturalWidth={1551}
/>

Then, add a few more sentences to train more data. You can follow this

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-18.webp"
  alt="nlst-18"
  naturalHeight={764}
  naturalWidth={1543}
/>

In our next example, we will do partial tagging by entering text and doing text selection on the word we want to tag. **The process of selecting text can be done by blocking one or more words at a time using a cursor.**

You can follow the example in this following picture. On the sentence "how much american all star", select only on the word "American all star"

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-19.webp"
  alt="nlst-19"
  naturalHeight={760}
  naturalWidth={1068}
/>

Then, select entity `type` to classify

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-20.webp"
  alt="nlst-20"
  naturalHeight={384}
  naturalWidth={1014}
/>

You can also enter a phrase "I want American all star pizza, two and bbq hand tossed one" and tag it like this

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-21.webp"
  alt="nlst-21"
  naturalHeight={1252}
  naturalWidth={1076}
/>

You may see a number beside an entity. That number represents how accurate an entity identifies a phrase (highest is 1.0)

Try to tag more sentences.

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-22.webp"
  alt="nlst-22"
  naturalHeight={948}
  naturalWidth={1074}
/>

Next, we will define parent entity using `BelongsTo`. Click on `BelongsTo` dropdown on `small` phrase, then select "Pepperoni". Final result looks like this

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-23.webp"
  alt="nlst-23"
  naturalHeight={954}
  naturalWidth={1070}
/>

### Testing NLU in Prediction Console

Use Test NLU to test a dataset.

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-24.webp"
  alt="nlst-24"
  naturalHeight={312}
  naturalWidth={846}
/>

Enter a word such as "i want two aas" (read: aas means American All Star). You can see the prediction result as you can see in this image

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-25.webp"
  alt="nlst-25"
  naturalHeight={1162}
  naturalWidth={992}
/>

## Adjusting the Dataset

When performing NLU prediction in Test NLU, sometimes the prediction result is wrong, incomplete, or still has a low confidence score.

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-26.webp"
  alt="nlst-26"
  naturalHeight={1072}
  naturalWidth={914}
/>

For example, the sentence above should be tagged as `intent:order`. However, prediction result has no prediction to order. To improve or fix a prediction, enter Log menu.

### Enter Log Menu

Go to Log menu under NLU

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-27.webp"
  alt="nlst-27"
  naturalHeight={628}
  naturalWidth={1839}
/>

On this page, you will see previous dataset when you have predicted on Test NLU.

### Fix The Prediction

We will adjust the dataset. Click on pencil icon (which placed in left icon)

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-28.webp"
  alt="nlst-28"
  naturalHeight={603}
  naturalWidth={1836}
/>

Then, select `intent:order`.

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-29.webp"
  alt="nlst-29"
  naturalHeight={714}
  naturalWidth={1084}
/>

Click train to revise the prediction. Trained data will be seen as follow.

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-30.webp"
  alt="nlst-30"
  naturalHeight={220}
  naturalWidth={1074}
/>

You will receive a notification after you click “Train”

### Test NLU with data that has been fixed

We will try to predict another dataset and see if the result has been improved. Click Test NLU and enter a phrase "hi, do you sell aas".

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/tutorials/nl-studio/nlst-31.webp"
  alt="nlst-31"
  naturalHeight={1148}
  naturalWidth={994}

Congratulations, now you have learned how to train entity in NL Studio.
