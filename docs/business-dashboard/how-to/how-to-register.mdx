### Introduction

In WhatsApp Business Dashboard, you can connect multiple WhatsApp accounts to the dashboard.

### How to use

1. To connect a new phone number, Go to the **WhatsApp Numbers** page by clicking from the left side navigation.

3. Once you have completed the registration process, your request will be reviewed by Facebook for approval. You can only use the registered number to send messages after it is approved. You will be notified through your email once your account is approved. Alternatively, see the WhatsApp number status on the data table on the **WhatsApp Numbers** page.
