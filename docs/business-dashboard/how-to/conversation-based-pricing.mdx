Starting February 1, 2022, WhatsApp will switch from a notification-based pricing model to a conversation-based pricing
model. Businesses will no longer be charged for sent notifications, instead, they will be charged per conversation. See
how it works below for more information.

## How It Works

WhatsApp Business API conversations fall into two different priced categories:

1. **User-initiated**, such as customer service and general inquiries (Inbound).
2. **Business-initiated**, such as notifications and notifications (Outbound).

All conversations or “Conversations” are measured in 24-hour increments, also known as “Sessions”, which start each time
the first message is delivered by the business. The first message can be a response to a user question or a
business-initiated message template that is being delivered.

Charges for conversations are based on the end user's phone number. Rates for business-initiated and user-initiated
conversations vary by market (country or region). See Rates for specific pricing information.

The first 1,000 conversations each month will be free, so your business can start building experiences your customers
will love before they have to pay. In addition, conversations will not be charged when a user sends a message to a
business using the call-to-action button on an Ad that clicks into WhatsApp or a Facebook Page CTA.

## Scenarios

<div className="info">
  <img className="borderless" src="/assets/images/icon-info.svg" />
  <p>
    Disclaimer: This scenario is based on The Official Facebook documentation. The complete scenario can be found
    <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing/conversationpricing" target="_blank">
      here
    </a>
  </p>
</div>

For the following scenarios, we will use a user named Anne Budianto, a Commercial Air (airline) customer, and Kicks (an
online shoe retailer).

Anne prefers to use WhatsApp to message businesses as it is the fastest way to get the support and information she
needs. Commercial Air and Kicks know that many of their customers prefer to connect via WhatsApp, so they are ready to
answer questions or send important updates via message.

#### 1. User-Initiated Conversation (UIC)

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/products/business-dashboard/based-pricing/table-1.webp"
  alt="based-pricing-table-1.webp"
  caption={{ title: 'Figure 1.a', description: 'Illustrated Scenario 1' }}
  naturalHeight={304}
  naturalWidth={299}
/>

**Scenario 1: User/customer service or general support questions in one 24-hour conversation session.**

1. Our user, Anne Budianto, messaged Commercial Air with a question about an upcoming reservation. When a Commercial Air
   reply message is sent, a 24-hour conversation session will start.
2. In this scenario, all additional messages are free within a 24-hour session. This encourages Commercial Air to follow
   up with support questions in a timely manner while giving users the ability to exchange as many messages as needed to
   resolve issues in a 24-hour session.
3. If Commercial Air continues to exchange messages with Anne after the initial 24-hour conversation session has ended,
   they will be charged for the new conversation. They will also be asked to send a message template to start a new
   conversation if it has been more than 24 hours since Anne's last message, which will be charged as a
   business-initiated conversation.
   In this scenario, Anne gets the info she needs about her reservation and Commercial Air pays for a single user-initiated
   conversation.

Cost: **IDR 320**, for 1 UIC

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/products/business-dashboard/based-pricing/table-2.webp"
  alt="based-pricing-table-2.webp"
  caption={{ title: 'Figure 1.b', description: 'Illustrated Scenario 2' }}
  naturalHeight={304}
  naturalWidth={299}
/>

**Scenario 2: A user/customer-initiated conversation that leads to two conversations with a Message Template.**

1. Anne wanted to check on an order she had made with Kicks, an online shoe retailer. He did it at 13:13.
2. Kicks have a bot set up to reply to basic order inquiries and respond to Anne with delivery details at 13:13.
3. As a follow-up the next day, the Kicks bot notified Anne that her order had shipped at 3:45 p.m.
   In this scenario, Kicks pays for one user-initiated conversation and one business-initiated conversation.
   Cost: **IDR 820**, for 1 UIC & 1 BIC

#### 2. Business-Initiated Conversation (UIC)

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/products/business-dashboard/based-pricing/table-3.webp"
  alt="based-pricing-table-3.webp"
  caption={{ title: 'Figure 2.a', description: 'Illustrated Scenario 3' }}
  naturalHeight={250}
  naturalWidth={299}
/>

**Scenario 3: Business initiates sending notification messages using Message Templates.**

1. When a flight is delayed or its status changes, Commercial Air notifies customers who have chosen to receive notifications using message templates.
2. Two message templates sent in one 24-hour conversation session result in one business-initiated conversation fee.
   In this scenario, Commercial Air wants to inform Anne that her flight is delayed by 30 minutes.
   Commercial Air will charge for one business-initiated conversation for sending these two message templates to Anne in a 24-hour conversation session.
   Cost: **IDR 500**, for 1 BIC

<FigureImage
  src="/assets/images/products/business-dashboard/based-pricing/table-4.webp"
  alt="based-pricing-table-4.webp"
  caption={{ title: 'Figure 2.b', description: 'Illustrated Scenario 4' }}
  naturalHeight={272}
  naturalWidth={299}
/>

**Scenario 4: The business initiates a conversation that leads to a two-way conversation with the user/customer.**

1. When a customer places a new order from Kicks, the online retailer sends a text message to confirm the order has been received and asks the customer if they would like to receive a notification when the order is shipped.
2. The customer selects Yes and chooses to receive additional order notifications.
   In this scenario, Kicks pays for one conversation initiated by the business.

If the user replies more than 24 hours after sending the initial business message and is followed by a business reply, it will result in a new conversation initiated by the user.

Cost:<br/>
a. **IDR 500**, for 1 BIC, if the user does not reply to the message.<br/>
b. **IDR 500**, for 1 BIC, if the user replies within 1x24 hours.<br/>
c. **IDR 820**, for 1 BIC & 1 UIC, if the user replies after 1x24 hours.<br/>

These are four common conversation scenarios between businesses and users. If you still have questions regarding the
comparison of the scenarios above, not limited to other possibilities that can occur between business and user
conversations, please contact the Kata.ai team to discuss it further.

## Pricing

The pricing scheme continues to use the credit system with a top-up in bulk. Imagine buying a prepaid cell phone number that will be reduced by Business-Initiated Conversation and/or User-Initiated Conversation according to the number of conversations initiated by businesses and users.

Don't worry because no major changes have occurred. We only convert credit purchases that previously used the number of messages to be sent, into Rupiah currency values ​​that can be used for the existing types of conversations. The tiering system still applies, the more credits you buy, the bigger the discount you get.

To accommodate changes in pricing schemes that occur, said the Business Dashboard to be updated to make it easier to use and monitor credit and the amount of usage. The latest update will be released on February 1, 2022, along with the price changes of the WhatsApp Business API.

## Credit Carry Over Policy

For loyal Kata.ai customers and our partners who still have a credit balance from purchases before replacement and price negotiations. Credit from your business can be converted and can still be valid until the expiration limit of the top-up purchase in the previous period.

Example:
Remaining credit 100,000 Template Message \* IDR 400 (old price) = **IDR 40,000,000** remaining credit that can be converted into conversations.
Remaining credit IDR 40,000,000 / IDR 500 (new price) = **80,000** Total Business-Initiated Conversation
Remaining credit IDR 40,000,000 / IDR 320 (new price) = **125,000** Total User-Initiated Conversation

The deduction for Business-Initiated Conversation and User-Initiated Conversation will use the new prices listed in point 1 above.

For other topics that have not been discussed in this notification letter or for further questions regarding this price plan change, please contact your consultant for further clarification or contact sales@kata.ai
