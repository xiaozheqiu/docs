### API

Application Programming Interface is a type of software that connects computers to another computer program.

### Bot

A bot is a software application that runs automated tasks.

### Chatbot

A chatbot is an application that allows humans to have online conversations with a computer via text or voice.

### Conversational AI

Conversational AI is a technology that allows interaction between humans and computers by making computers understand natural language and mimic human conversations. Conversational AI products communicate by recognizing voice and text, understanding intents, translating multiple languages, and responding to human conversations. Automated messaging apps, text-to-speech, or virtual assistants are examples of conversational AI products.

### End-user

In conversational AI product development, an end-user is a person who ultimately uses or is intended to use the product.

### Fallback

Fallback is a situation when the bot does not understand what the end-user said.

### FAQ

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) is a list of questions with answers relating to a particular subject.

### FSD

Functional Specification Diagram is a document designed to give an overview of how the software works. This document outlines each of the features and shows a step-by-step flow.

### Human-agent

Human-agent is a real person that interacts with end-users through conversational AI products such as chatbots.

### Intent

Intent is a purpose or goal. Within conversational AI, intent refers to what goal or purpose an end-user has in mind while interacting with a bot. This intent is extracted from the end-user utterance, and then the bot translates it to answer with the appropriate response. For example, an end-user wants to buy a pizza. You can build the bot with a designated reply that offers the pizza menu.
There are two types of intents in the Kata Platform; Initial Intent and Follow-up Intent. An initial intent is the one you set at the beginning of the conversation, while follow-up is the following intent. A bot cannot start a conversation without an Initial Intent.

### Kata CLI

Kata CLI is a command-line interface that users use to interact with the Kata Platform.

### Kata Platform

Kata Platform is an ecosystem of applications and services developers use to build NLP products and conversational AI.

### Kata ML

KataML or Kata Markup Language is a computer language that uses tags or markup to write bot designs.

### Message

A message is a conversation unit delivered by bots to end-users or vice versa in text, voice, or media. It consists of incoming messages and outgoing messages.

### NLP

Natural Language Processing is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence involved with the interactions between computers and human language. NLP discusses how computers can process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

### Omnichannel

Omnichannel is a multi-channel communication between end-users and human-agents. Kata Omnichat is an omnichannel product from Kata.ai which provides integrated channels such as Instagram and WhatsApp.

### Session

A session is an exchange of information between two or more communication devices or between a bot and an end-user. It has a start and an endpoint that you can define by a certain point. For example, Kata Platform measures one session from the start of a conversation until the end-user does not reply until 5 minutes.

### Transcripts

A transcript is a conversation context between chatbot and end-user that consists of text and media, in which users can download and show information based on filters.
