Kata ML is a descriptive YAML-based language for defining bots. The entry-point of KataML-based bot is the bot.yml file.

## Specification

The root structure of bot.yml is as following:

```
# kataML schema definition
schema: kata.ai/schema/kataml/1.0

# Bot name
name: test-bot
# Bot description
desc: Some Bot
# Bot language
lang: id

# Flow definition
flows:
	 # flowName and description
	 someFlow:
		# you can include other files using $include directive
		intents: $include(./some/path)

# Method definitions
methods:
	 # method definition in javascript
	 someMethod(x): x*x

# NLU definition
nlus:
	 # define NLU to be used in this bot
	 someNlu: ...

# Config
config:
	 # free to define your nested configuration

```

## Include Directive

KataML support `$include` directive to include definition from other files. Using this directive it is easier to structure your bot project.
Example:

```
config: $include(./config.yml)
```

## Building a flow

A flow consists of following definitions:

- `intents` :`Dict<Intent>` which means intent definitions.
- `states` : `Dict<State>` which means state definitions.
- `actions` : `Dict<Action>` which means action definitions.
- `methods` : `Dict<string>` which means Flow-specific method definitions
  Additionally a flow can be set as following:
- `active` : `boolean` which means you can enable/disable a flow by setting the active field of a flow.
- `volatile` : `boolean` which means you can set it to true, then it will close the flow whenever itâ€™s outside the flow.
- `expire` : `number` which means it will set flow to expire after a specified number of milliseconds.

## Building an intent

Intent can be defined as following:

```
intents:
 <name>: <Intent>
```

The intent description contains following fields:

- `type` : `"text" | "command" | "data"` which is to define type of the message to be associated with this intent.
- `condition` : `string | string[]` which is condition filter to rule out certain intents to be selected.
- `classifier` : `Classifier | Classifier[]` which is classifier definition.
- `attributes` : `Dict<Attribute>` which is attributes / slot filling associated with the intent.
- `fallback` : `boolean` which means define intent as fallback intent.
- `priority` : `number` which means set priority of an intent for the selection process
- `initial` : `boolean` which means set whether intent can be triggered only in current flow or from other flow as well.

## Defining condition

Condition is every valid javascript expression returning a boolean. Available variables are:

- `type` : `string` which is a message type.
- `payload` : `JsonObject` which means message payload.
- `content` : `string` which means message content.
- `context` : `JsonObject` which means flow context.
- `data` : `JsonObject` which means session data.
- `config` : `JsonObject` which means bot config.
  Example:

```
condition: type == 'text' && content == 'hello' && !context.completed
```

## Building classifier

Classifier consists of following fields:

- `nlu` : `string` which means name of defined NLU or NLU-type.
- `hint` : `string` which means prepend message with a text fragment.
- `match` : `string` which means match the result of the classifier with a specific string.
- `options` : `JsonObject` which means override NLU options.
- `process` : `method | method[]` which means postprocess intent using methods.
  Example:

```
classifier:
	 nlu: topicClassifier
	 match: food
	 options:
		lowerCase: true
		threshold: 0.8
```

Example Multiple Classifiers:

```
classifier:
 - nlu: topicClassifier
	match: food
 - nlu: keywordClassifier
	match: food
```

Example mapping label using dict:

```
classifier:
	nlu: topicClassifier
	match: food
	dict:
	 food: [food_a, food_b], # group multiple classes to one
	 test: testing # change label
```

## Defining attributes

Attribute consist of following fields:

- `nlu` : `string` which means name of defined NLU or NLU-type.
- `hint` : `string` which means prepend message with a text fragment.
- `path` : `string` which means result path to be taken.
- `options` : `JsonObject` which means override NLU options.
- `process` : `method | method[]` which means postprocess intent using methods.
  Example:

```
attributes:
city:
	nlu: genericNER
	path: LOCATION
	options:
	threshold: 0.6
	process:
	  - filterCity
	  - capitalize
```

Example normalizing using dict:

```
attributes:
	 city:
		nlu: genericNER
		path: location
		options:
		  threshold: 0.6
		dict:
		  jakarta: [jkt, jekardah, jakarta]
		  bandung: [bdg, bandung]
		  default: invalid
```

## Building a state

States can be defined as following:

```
states:
	<name>: <State>
```

The state description contains following fields:

- `initial` : `boolean` which means specify initial state.
- `action` : `string | StateAction | StateAction[]` which means specify action to be executed.
- `end` : `boolean` which means specify end state.
- `transitions` : `Dict<Transition|string>` which means specify transitions.
- `float` : `Transition` which means specify floating transition
- `enter` : `Mapping | method` which means specify mapping or method to be executed when state is entered.
- `transit` : `Mapping | method` which means specify mapping or method to be executed when transition is started.
- `exit` : `Mapping | method` which means specify mapping or method to be executed when state is exited.

## Defining mapping

Mapping is a procedure to update context / data. available variables are:

- `attributes` : `JsonObject` which is attributes that is captured by intent
- `intent` : `string` which is captured intent
- `content` : `string` which is message content
- `payload` : `JsonObject` which is message payload
- `context` : `JsonObject` which is flow context
- `data` : `JsonObject` which is session data
  Example:

```
enter:
	 data.name: attributes.name
	 context.count: (context.count || 0)++
```

Example using method:

```
enter: someMapping
```

method definition:

```
methods:
	someMapping(ctx): > # {intent, attributes, content, payload, data, context}
		ctx.data.name = ctx.attributes.name;
		ctx.context.count++;
		return ctx;
```

## Building state actions

Action can be defined as a single action or multiple actions. The state action definition contains following fields:

- `name` : `string` is name of defined action or action type
- `condition` : `string` is condition filter
- `options` : `JsonObject` is override action options
  Example:

```
action:
	 name: reply
	 options:
		text: 'hi!'
```

Example multiple actions:

```
action:
	 - name: reply
		condition: context.mood = 'good'
		options:
		  text: 'hi $(data.name)!'
	 - name: reply
		condition: context.mood = 'bad'
		options:
		  text: 'apaan sih kamu!'
```

You can simplify state actions (if you only have 1 action in some states) :

```
action: someAction
```

## Building transition

Transition define condition that leads to moving from one state to the other state. A transition is defined as following:

```
transitions:
	 <destination>: <Transition>
```

Field definition:

- `condition` : `string` which means condition that trigger the transition
- `priority` : `number` which means priority for transition selection
- `fallback` : `boolean` which means define fallback when no other transition matches
- `mapping` : `Mapping | method` which means define mapping or method that is triggered during this transition
  Example:

```
transitions:
	 askDob:
		condition: "intent == 'yes' && !context.personGender && context.verifyGender"
		mapping:
		  context.personGender: 'context.verifyGender'
		  context.verifyGender: 'null'
```

You can simplify transitions definition :

```
transitions
	askDob: "intent == 'yes' && !context.personGender"
```

## Building a floating State

Normally it is tedious if we have to define a transition to a state that is available in every state. e.g. Cancel state. To mitigate this we can define a floating transition. The system will automatically attach this transition in every state.

```
float: <Transition>
```

## Defining events

We can define a mapping or method that is triggered during these events:

- `enter` which means this event is triggered when entering a state
- `transit` which means this event is triggered before transition process
- `exit` which means this event is triggered after transition process

## Building Meta Context

Additional meta context accessible in states at `context.<meta>`:

- `$start` : `boolean` which means true if state is initial state
- `$to` : `string` which means describe destination state. Available during exit
- `$from` : `string` which means describe origin state. Available during enter
- `$end` : `boolean` which means true if state is end state
  Example:

```
states:
	 stateA:
		enter:
		  context.stateACount: (context.stateACount || 0)++
		transit:
		  context.name: attributes.name || null
		exit:
		  context.stateA.to: context.$to
```

## Building actions

Actions can be defined as following:

```
actions:
 <name>: <Action>
```

Following fields are available:

- `type` : `string` which means action type.
- `method` : `method` which means specify if action type is method
- `options`: `JsonObject` which means action options
- `condition` : `string` which means action condition
  Example:

```
actions:
	 askName:
		type: reply
		options:
		  text: 'nama kamu siapa?'
```

## Flow Switching

Whenever bot reaches a state that is not an end state, the flow will stay open. The following message will trigger a transition to the next state. There is a case where the incoming message cannot be handled by any intents in current flow. In that case it will try to find a flow with a matching intent. When the second flow closes, the system will create internal message reenter.

```
{
	type: "command",
	content: "reenter",
	payload: null
}
```

this reenter need to be catched by the previous flow that is open:

```
intents:
	reenter:
		type: command
		condition: content == "reenter"
```

## Building NLU

### Definition

A NLU consists of following definitions:

- `type`: `string` which means NLU Type
- `method` : `method` which means method name
- `options` : `JsonObject` which means Override NLU options
- `process` : `method | method[]` which means Postprocess intent using methods
  Example:

```
nlus:
	 genericNer:
		type: verstandTagger
		options:
		model: <id>
```

### Keyword NLU

```
myNLU:
	type: keyword
	options:
		case: boolean # true for case sensitive
		exact: boolean # true to match only exact message
		default: string # default key if nothing match
		keywords: # <key> : [<match values>]
		<key>: string[]
```

Output:

```
string
```

Example:

```
options:
	 keywords:
		'American Thin Crust':
		  - thin crust
		  - american thin crust
		  - american
		'Hawaiian':
		  - hawai
		  - hawaiian
```

### Regex NLU

```
myRegex:
	 type: regex
	 options:
		regex: <regex as string>
		index: number # optional
```

or

```
myRegex:
	type: regex
	options:
		regex: <regex as string>
		index:
		<key>: number
```

or

```
myRegex:
	 type: regex
	 options:
		regex:
		 <key>: <regex as string>
```

Example with index:

```
nlus:
	 nameNLU:
		type: regex
		options:
		  regex: 'nama saya (.+)'
		  index: 1

## usage in intent
intents:
	 giveName:
		attributes:
		  name:
		  nlu: nameNLU
```

Example with multiple index:

```
nlus:
	 nameNLU:
		type: regex
		options:
		  regex: 'nama (saya|kamu) (.+)'
		  index:
		  who: 1
		  name: 2

## usage in intent
intents:
	 giveName:
		attributes:
		  name:
		  nlu: nameNLU
		  path: who
		  who:
		  nlu: nameNLU
		  path: name
```

Example with multiple regex:

```
nlus:
	 regexNlu:
	type: regex
	options:
		  regex:
		  name: 'nama saya (.+)'
		  email: 'w+@w+.w+'

## usage in intent
intents:
	 giveName:
		attributes:
		  name:
		  nlu: regexNlu
		  path: name
		  who:
		  nlu: regexNLU
		  path: email
```

### NL Studio NLU

```
mynl:
	 type: nl
	 options:
		nluId: <nluId>
		token: <nluToken>
		output:
		  <type>
		  # raw - return the raw prediction result from NL Studio
		  # value - return the value of each NLU's entity
		  # phrase - only for NL Studio entity type 'phrase'
		entity: <entityName> # only for output: phrase
		threshold: <number> # confidence rate, if less than treshold bot wouldn't recognize as this intent
		flatten: true # optional, default false
```

Examples:

```
## usage in intent for output type value
nlus:
	 mynl:
		type: nl
		options:
		  nluId: <nluId>
		  output: value
		  threshold: 0.5
		  flatten: true

intents:
	 yes:
		classifier:
		  nlu: mynl
		  expression: "intent == 'yes'" # <entityName> == <label> of entity type 'trait'
	 name:
		classifier:
		  nlu: mynl
		  expression: ner # <entityName> of entity type 'phrase'
		attributes:
		  person:
		  nlu: mynl
		  path: ner # <entityName>

## usage in intent for output type phrase
nlus:
	 mynl2:
		type: nl
		options:
		  nluId: <nluId>
		  output: phrase
		  entity: <entityName>
		  threshold: 0.7

intents:
	credentials:
		classifier:
		  nlu: mynl # use the previous bot's nlu
		  expression: "intent == 'giveCredentials'"
		attributes:
		  person:
		  nlu: mynl2
		  path: person Â  # <label> of mynl2's entity <enityName>
		  location:
		  nlu: mynl2
		  path: location # <label> of mynl2's entity <enityName>
		 name:
		classifier:
		  nlu: mynl2
		  expression: person # <label> of mynl2's entity <enityName>
		attributes:
		  person:
		  nlu: mynl2
		  path: person # <label>

# alternative approach
nlus:
	mynl3:
		type: nl
		options:
		nluId: <nluId>

intents:
	 yes:
		classifier:
		  nlu: mynl3
		  options:
		  output: value
		  threshold: 0.5
		  flatten: true
		  expression: "intent == 'yes'"
		attributes:
		  person:
		  nlu: mynl3
		  path: person
		  options:
			  output: phrase
			  entity: ner
			  threshold: 0.7
```

Example:

```
methods:
	someMethod(x): "
	  return x*x;
	"
```

### Method from File

Example:

```
