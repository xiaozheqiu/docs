## What is Bulk Training

Great NL models are a fundamental part of making a great chatbot and approximately 70% of all chatbot projects use NL models instead of a keyword-based approach, based on our Kata.ai projects data.

Previously, the bulk training process was very technical because developers needed to use KataCLI and view the results on the Platform GUI (<a href="https://platform.kata.ai" target="_blank"><span>http</span>s://platform.kata.ai</a>). This back and forth switching of tools was required to do training.

Now, you can use the new Bulk Training on the Platform GUI itself to train more than 200 sentences/training data at once. These are the screenshots of our newest feature.

## How Bulk Training Might Help You?

Training NL models is one of the most time-consuming processes in chatbot development, which could take approximately 6 weeks. On average, a complex chatbot project requires 1,000 data for their NL models. It’s not ideal to train the sentences one by one, as a typical 1,000-sentence NL model would easily take more than 4 hours to train.

Hence, bulk training can significantly reduce the training effort with a simplified user flow

## How to Use Bulk Training

### Create a Project

Mission: Create a new project.
Prerequisite: You already have a Platform account and have logged in.

1. Click on the **Create Project** button.
2. Fill in the required fields for the project.
3. Click **Create Project**.

### Create Entities And Labels With Type "trait"

Mission: Create NL models to be trained and type entity “trait”. Learn more about entity type “trait”.
Prerequisites: You already have a project.

1. Go to **NLU**.
2. Click on **Entities**.
3. Click the **Create Entity** button to start creating entities and labels. Learn more about entities and labels or you may want to explore how to design the NLU.
4. Fill in fields with this example.

```
Entity name: intent
Type: trait
Profile: default - Text classification
```

5. To create labels, you need to type and press “enter” to save a new label. Fill in with these examples.

```
Labels: greetings, thank you

/>

7. Click **Create** to create a new entity with "greetings" and "thank you" labels.

### Create Entities And Labels With Type "phrase"

Mission: Create NL models to be trained and type entity “phrase”. Learn more about entity type “trait”.
Prerequisites: You already have a project.

1. Click the **Create Entity** button to start creating entities and labels. Learn more about entities and labels or you may want to explore how to design the NLU
2. Fill in fields with these examples:

```
Entity name: object
Type: phrase
Profile: default - Default phrase
```

3. To create labels, you need to type and press “enter” to save a new pile. Fill in with this example:

### Guideline to Create a Training Data

Before we use the NL bulk training, we will create training data using a simple syntax. “#’ for entity type “trait” and “@” for entity type “phrase”. Learn more about entity type “trait” and entity type “phrase”.

This syntax is only allowed for entity type “trait”

```
Saya mau pesan pizza #intent:order
```

This means that the sentence is classified into **entity name: intent** with **label: order**

```
Totalnya berapa ya? #intent:ask #questionType:how_much
```

This means that the sentence is classified into **entity name: intent** with **label: order** and **entity name: questionType** with **label: how_much**

This syntax is only allowed for entity type “phrase”

```
Saya mau pesan tiket ke (@destination Malang) atas nama (@ner:person Budi) #intent:order
```

This means that the word “Malang” is tagged for **entity name: destination** and “Budi” is tagged for **entity name: ner** with **label: person**

### Create New Training Data

Mission: Create new training data in a .txt extension file. In this step, you will need to open a text and source code editor such as Notepad (in Windows), <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/" target="_blank">notepad++</a>, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime</a>, etc.
Prerequisites: You already have a project and entities.

1. Open your text and source code editor (Notepad, notepad++, sublime, etc.)
2. Create a new file.
3. Type following sentences example to create training data to train our NL models. You can add up to 200 sentences/training data. Or, you can download <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ErLuDwa6_1hyfnV7zVNBrlleE7l3KCb0/view" target="_blank">this example</a>.

```
selamat pagi #intent:greetings
welcome #intent:greetings
nama saya (@object:person amanda), salam kenal ya #intent:greetings
kemarin saya lihat (@object:person amanda) dan (@object:person rizyan) bercengkerama
hari ini cerah ya kata (@object:person destri)
morning everyone!! #intent:greetings
```

4. Save the following training data into a file named: training-data-example.txt

### Upload Training Data And Perform Data Training
