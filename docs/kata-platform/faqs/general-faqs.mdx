### Is it possible to use NL from different projects?

You may define them in NLUs. Learn more about how to integrate chatbots using NLU.

### How do I give access to anyone to access and update content on my CMS Client Dashboard?

You can invite anyone registered to Kata Platform or unregistered to access your CMS Client under the User menu on Kata CMS.

### Can I roll back to the previous version?

Yes, you can roll back to previous versions on the Version Page. However, please note this action will create a new version using the old version setup. For example, you’re on version 1.0.1 now and would like to roll back to version 1.0.0. When you hit that roll back button, it will create a new version, 1.0.2, with the same setup as version 1.0.0.

### What is TPS (Transaction per Second) in the Kata Platform?

TPS stands for Transaction per Second. A transaction consists of incoming & outgoing message traffic through the Kata Platform. So, we have a limit for the transaction happening in each project in the Kata Platform.

### What do you mean by the limit for the transaction?

We limit the incoming & outgoing message traffic in the Kata Platform. Think of it as bandwidth. The bigger your project’s TPS limit, the bigger your bandwidth for message traffic processing.

### How do we know the TPS limit for our project?

We separate the categories of the project into two: Paid Project & Free Project.

- We offer an exclusive TPS limit for each **Paid Project**. Also, all paid projects will have a verified badge in the Kata Platform.

- **For Free Project**: we offer a shared TPS limit across the Free Project’s users.
  Should you need help to upgrade from Free Project to Paid Project or upgrade your TPS limit, please contact us (business@kata.ai), and we’ll be happy to assist you.

### What is the impact of the TPS limit on my project?

When your project has reached the TPS limit, the following message will have to wait until the previous message has done processing—resulting in your user experiencing a delay in receiving or sending the message. So, the bigger your TPS limit, the bigger your project’s bandwidth to process the message, resulting in less delay. It’s essential if your project has a significant customer base. We will also send an email notification to the project creator when the Paid Project has reached the TPS limit.

### Does the TPS limit apply to all channels in the Kata Platform?

Yes, the TPS limit applies to all channels through the Kata Platform and are used by FIFO (First In First Out) method (e.g., if the first message is from WhatsApp and the second is from Facebook Messenger. Then the message from WhatsApp is processed first, followed by the message from Facebook Messenger)

### Can I switch from Paid Project to Free Project?

Unfortunately, no, but you’re free to choose among the available subscription plans.

### How do I upgrade my Free Project to Paid Project?

We’re glad you have decided to support us! Please let us know your interest via email: business@kata.ai, and we would be happy to assist you.

### Does using the emulator in the Kata Platform count as transaction usage?

No, emulator usage isn’t affected by the TPS limiter.

### Does the TPS limiter also apply for on-premise deployment?

Currently no, TPS limiter only applies to cloud deployment.
