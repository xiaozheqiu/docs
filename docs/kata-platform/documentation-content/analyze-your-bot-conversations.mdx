## Introduction

In the Kata Platform, you can view various reports and analytics regarding your chatbots. Whether it’s to analyze the end-user (read: chatbot’s user) behavior, chatbot’s most popular topic and keyword, or even chat log between your chatbot and its end-user, we got you covered.

There are 3 main features you can choose:

- **Users** feature provides you the end-user information such as the number of new users, active users, and many more.
- **Topics** feature is a feature that relates to what topics, flows, or states that the end-user is asking the most.
- **Transcripts** is a feature to see end-user conversations with a chatbot.

Let’s elaborate on each feature definition and functionalities.

## Users

The Users feature contains the data of your end-user. First is the filter option on top of the feature screen.

### User Filter

You can filter the analytics based on:

- **Environment** is a container your chatbot is deployed to. In Kata Platform, we have 3 environments: Development, Staging, or Production. Environment is a part when creating channels.
- **Channel** is a deployed messaging platform where your bot lives.
- **Date** is a feature to choose the date range for your analytics data. Note that you can only view maximum 2 months data at a time. For a broader date range, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@kata.ai">support@kata.ai</a>.

### Various User Analytics

  caption={{ title: 'Figure 2', description: 'Various user analytics data.' }}
  layout="responsive"
  naturalHeight={625}
  naturalWidth={1999}
/>

After selecting the filter, we can view specific data for your chatbot:

- **New and Returning Users**: an analytics graphic to show the number of end-users who used the chatbot first-time and repeatedly.
- **Active Users**: number of end-users who repeatedly used the chatbot in total.
- **Sessions**: a session count when the end-user engages in conversation with the bot until the conversation ends. A session counts as “ended” when your end-user does not reply to the bot until 5 minutes after.
- **New Users**: number of end-users that used the chatbot for the first time. If your end-user chats “Hi” for the first time to your bot, then it will be counted as 1. This metric cannot be applied to Whatsapp.
- **Messages**: number of total messages received (incoming messages) and sent (outgoing messages) through the chatbot.

### User Activities

In User Activities, you can see how many sessions, active users, messages, and new users your chatbot has throughout the date range. You can also hover at any date to view the stats for that day. The data can be downloaded in CSV format.

### Peak Hours

  naturalHeight={1069}
  naturalWidth={1999}
/>

In Peak Hour's analytics, you can analyze at what day and time the end-users are more engaged with your chatbot. The blue color indicates engagement. The darker the blue, the more engagement the end-user has with your chatbot on that specific day & time.

Notice on Monday at 12PM, when you hover the block, there are 28 incoming messages with dark blue color, indicating on that day and time the end-user is more active. You can use this analysis to make a better decision as to when is the best time to engage with your user.

    Important note: The cohort data is standalone analytics, which means the data is shown not filtered by date range.
  </p>
</div>

Cohort analysis allows us to see end-user retention which shows the engagement level of end-users to the bot. For example, it counts **active users** who interact with our bot on month 0 and return on the following month (month 1), and return after the next following month (month 2), the higher the percentage of users that returned on month 1, 2, and 3 showing that our bot has a high **retention level**.

It has a **cohort size** to choose a range which are **monthly, weekly, daily** (default daily):

- Monthly will show **2 previous months** from today.
- Weekly will show **11 previous weeks** from today.
- Daily will show **14 previous days** from today.

It has a download **button** to export data to a CSV file. We define **5 colors** as follows:

- **A dark** color for the **100%** active users.
- **A medium-dark** color for **75% to 100%** active users .
- **Medium-light** color for **50% to 76%** active users.
- **Light** color for **25% to 51%** active users.
- **White** for **0% to 26%** active users.

## Topics

The **Topics** option within the analytics dashboard contains information regarding mostly used features in your platform. The first thing you will find is a box with 3 filters, which allows you to obtain customized information based on your chosen filters.
