When you are in step 3, you need to enter the agent information as shown below:

<Table>
  <TableHead>
    <TableHeadRow>
      <TableHeadCell>Field Name</TableHeadCell>
      <TableHeadCell>Description</TableHeadCell>
    </TableHeadRow>
  </TableHead>
  <TableBody>
    <TableBodyRow>
      <TableBodyCell>Agent Name</TableBodyCell>
      <TableBodyCell>Enter the name of your agent or additional admin. For example Katherine Wong</TableBodyCell>
    </TableBodyRow>
    <TableBodyRow>
      <TableBodyCell>Role</TableBodyCell>
      <TableBodyCell>
        The role of the person you invited to. You can choose the person that you assign as an agent or administrator
        <strong>If Agent</strong>, Agents with this role can only access inboxes, reports, and conversations. They can assign
        conversations to other agents or themselves and resolve conversations
      </TableBodyCell>
    </TableBodyRow>
    <TableBodyRow>
      <TableBodyCell>-</TableBodyCell>
      <TableBodyCell>
        <strong>If Administrator</strong>, Administrator will have access to all Kata Omnichat features enabled for your
        account, including settings, along with all of a normal agents' privileges
      </TableBodyCell>
    </TableBodyRow>

      <TableBodyCell>Add the Email address of the person youâ€™ve invited to join</TableBodyCell>
    </TableBodyRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

When adding agents and administrators, there are 2 status:

1. **Pending Verification** that means the email invitation has been sent to the invited one. Action is needed from the invited agent or administrator to confirm the invitation
2. **Verified** that means the invited agent and administrator has confirmed the invitation, then they can explore the dashboard
