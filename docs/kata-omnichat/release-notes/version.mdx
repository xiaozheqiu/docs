### What’s New ⭐️

Are you a business owner? Do you have many agents for some messaging platforms to handle customers’ inquiries? Or even, do you sometimes need a bot for your Instagram Business Messaging and WhatsApp Business API to help your agents with some repeated questions? 🤔

This new product is definitely suitable for you! 🎉

We’re building Kata Omnichat 2.0, so it will be the replacement for the old one. This centralized agent dashboard will help your agents respond to any customers’ inquiries rapidly without switching from one messaging app to another messaging app. Also, if needed, an agent bot will be a savior to collaborate with your agents. Learn more about [Agent Bot](/kata-omnichat/configure-your-agent-chatbot/setup-agent-bot-in-kata-omnichat).

### What’s been fixed 🛠

Changing the whole user experience to make it seamless and easier for you and your agents and having two most popular messaging platforms; Instagram Messaging and WhatsApp Business. This product will be very flexible for you, you don’t need to have a bot at the first time, but you can add it anytime you need it.

We’re updating some bugs in Kata Omnichat 2.0:

- Fixed users can’t download reports to CSV
- Fixed users can’t see/know customer’s WA number in Contacts
- Fixed users can’t see previous messages in WA
- Fixed users can’t get email verification
