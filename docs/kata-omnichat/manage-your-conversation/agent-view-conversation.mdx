As an agent, you will see the conversations that were assigned to you, both manual assignment or auto-assignment. In the conversation box, you will see 2 options in tab: **Mine** and **Unassigned**. Learn more about these below:

1. **Unassigned:** The first incoming message that is not assigned to you. This will help the agent to identify which conversation is not awarded by agents
2. **Mine**: The incoming conversation that has already been assigned to me. This will help the admin to identify which chat needs to handle
