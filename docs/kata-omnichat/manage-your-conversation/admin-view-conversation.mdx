Every conversation in Kata Omnichat can belong to at least one assigned agent. There is a case to assign the conversation, either manually or automatically. Admin can assign to the bot, agent, another admin, or the system will assign them automatically. In another case, an agent can assign to another agent. In this documentation, you can learn how to manage your conversation, from the incoming message into the resolved message.

In Kata Omnichat, There will be 3 kinds of conversations: **Open**, **resolve,** and **bot** conversation.

1. **Open:** The conversation that has not been resolved by agent yet
2. **Resolved**: The conversation that has been resolved. Learn more about resolving messages [here](/kata-omnichat/manage-your-conversation/resolve-conversation)
3. **Bot**: The conversation that is handled by the bot and can be takeover by agent anytime

## Admin view conversation

As admin, you will see all incoming conversations to your inboxes. In the conversation box, you will see 3 options in the tab: **Mine, Unassigned,** and **All**. Learn more about these as below:

1. **Unassigned:** The first incoming message will go to **unassigned conversation**. This will help admin to identify which conversation needs to be assigned. Admin needs to assign an online agent to move the conversation from unassigned. Learn more to assign to your agent [here](/kata-omnichat/manage-your-conversation/manual-agent-assignment)
2. **Mine**: The incoming conversation that has already been assigned to me as an agent. This will help the admin to identify which chat needs to handle
3. **All:** All conversations will be recorded in the All tab, both assigned or unassigned
