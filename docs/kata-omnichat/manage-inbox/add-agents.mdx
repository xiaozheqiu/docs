The last step before completing the inbox is to add your agents. You can add agents that have been invited and verified. Or, if you donâ€™t have any agents yet, you can just add admin first and add another agent later.

Lastly, your inbox has been created and you can check from the sidebar in the **Inboxes** submenu.
